I wish you best of luck\nAnd now I'm finna throw them deuces up\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]\nI'm on some new shit\nI'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)\nI'm moving on to something better, better, better\nNo more tryna make it work (Deuces)\nYou made me wanna say bye bye\nSay bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)\nYou made me wanna say bye bye\nSay bye bye, say bye bye to her\n\n\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nWhat you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed\nI'm waitin' in my hotel room\nSeems like we're arguin' more and it's gettin' less romantic\nYeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon\nBut I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will\nI'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel\nI mean, this part of our relationship's amazin' still\nI might just put up with the arguin' and stay, for real\nYou lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes\nYou with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh\nI'm willin' to work it out however long it takes you\nYou feel like you miss those happy days\nWell, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong\nYour friends always tyin' up every line on your phone\nYeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus\nAnd the hardest part about the fuckin' business\nIs mindin' your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off\n\nWe just yell until we tired, then I break you off\nIt's useless, all this fightin', let's get past it now\nEven when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around\n\n[Verse 3: Kanye West]\n\nYou know what, yo? You a bitch\nYou should have a travel agent, ‘cause you a trip\nYou should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit\nBut all you got is some fuckin' issues, you fuckin' bitch\nI hate niggas, but I love your mom\nGive her a kiss for me, her second son\nGet your mind right, baby, or get your shit together\nYou gonna be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever\nGirl seducers, they come in deuces\nBut when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance\nNiggas take my old flows and they take my old swag\nHe just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch (Haha)\nI'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on\nWhat I'm dealin' with is too real for me to comment on\nJay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth\n\nSo when you talk 'bout “you know who”\nI don't know who you talkin' 'bout\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]\nI'm on some new shit\nI'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)\nI'm moving on to something better, better, better\nNo more tryna make it work (Deuces)\nYou made me wanna say bye bye\nSay bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)\nYou made me wanna say bye bye\nSay bye bye, say bye bye to her\n\n[Verse 4: Andre 3000]\nThe farewell email from a female\nBut I’m a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details\nWhat it entails is hard to say, like sellin' seashells\nBy the seashore, but she’s not a bore\nBut neither a whore who needs to know more\n\nThe kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for\nOr run in your favorite store, and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours\nI did things for her; ain't rich, ain't poor\nI wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her\nWell enough to know if this is all she came for\nBut enough to know tonight excited she came four\nTimes to my cousin house to see if I was there\nGet your minds out the gutter, man\nWe out here tryna have a good time\nAnd here I am, all heavy with the words where\nSomebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward\nBut, shit, they asked for it\nIt’s hard to throw up them deuces\n‘Cause when you know it’s juicy\n\nYou start to sound like Confucius when makin' up excuses\n\nChase the Cabooses until the track gone\nI gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin' sad songs\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]\nI'm on some new shit\nI'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)\nI'm moving on to something better, better, better\nNo more tryna make it work (Deuces)\nYou made me wanna say bye bye\nSay bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)\nYou made me wanna say bye bye\nSay bye bye, say bye bye to her"
