I wish you best of luck\nAnd now I'm finna throw them deuces up\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]\nI'm on some new shit\nI'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)\nI'm moving on to something better, better, better\nNo more tryna make it work (Deuces)\nYou made me wanna say bye bye\nSay bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)\nYou made me wanna say bye bye\nSay bye bye, say bye bye to her\n\n\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nWhat you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed\nI'm waitin' in my hotel room\nSeems like we're arguin' more and it's gettin' less romantic\nYeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon\nBut I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will\nI'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel\nI mean, this part of our relationship's amazin' still\nI might just put up with the arguin' and stay, for real\nYou lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes\nYou with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh\nI'm willin' to work it out however long it takes you\nYou feel like you miss those happy days\nWell, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong\nYour friends always tyin' up every line on your phone\nYeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus\nAnd the hardest part about the fuckin' business\nIs mindin' your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off\nWe just yell until we tired, then I break you off\nIt's useless, all this fightin', let's get past it now\nEven when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]\nI'm on some new shit\nI'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)\nI'm moving on to something better, better, better\nNo more tryna make it work (Deuces)\nYou made me wanna say bye bye\nSay bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)\nYou made me wanna say bye bye\nSay bye bye, say bye bye to her\n\n\n\n[Verse 3: Kanye West]\nYou know what, yo? You a bitch\nYou should have a travel agent, ‘cause you a trip\nYou should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit\nBut all you got is some fuckin' issues, you fuckin' bitch\nI hate niggas, but I love your mom\nGive her a kiss for me, her second son\nGet your mind right, baby, or get your shit together\nYou gonna be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever\nGirl seducers, they come in deuces\nBut when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance\nNiggas take my old flows and they take my old swag\nHe just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch (Haha)\nI'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on\nWhat I'm dealin' with is too real for me to comment on\nJay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth\nSo when you talk 'bout “you know who”\nI don't know who you talkin' 'bout\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]\nI'm on some new shit\nI'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)\nI'm moving on to something better, better, better\nNo more tryna make it work (Deuces)\nYou made me wanna say bye bye\nSay bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)\nYou made me wanna say bye bye\nSay bye bye, say bye bye to her"
