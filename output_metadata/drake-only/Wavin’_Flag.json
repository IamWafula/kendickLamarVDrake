    "When I get older",
    "I will be stronger",
    "They'll call me freedom",
    "Just like a waving flag",
    "Born from a throne, older than Rome",
    "But violent prone, poor people zone",
    "But it's my home, all I have known",
    "Where I got grown, but now it's gone",
    "Out of the darkness, in came the carnage",
    "Threatening my very survival",
    "Fractured my streets and broke all my dreams",
    "Now feels like defeat to wretched retreat",
    "So we struggling",
    "Fighting to eat",
    "And we wondering",
    "If we'll be free",
    "We can not wait for some faithful day",
    "It's too far away so right now I'll say",
    "When I get older, I will be stronger",
    "They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag",
    "And then it goes back, and then it goes back",
    "And then it goes back",
    "So many wars, settling scores",
    "All that we've been through and now there is more",
    "I hear them say love is the way",
    "Love is the answer that's what they say",
    "But were not just dreamers of broken down grievers",
    "A hand will reach us and will not forsake us",
    "This can't control us, no it can't hold us down",
    "We gon' pick it up even though we still struggling",
    "Au nom de la survie",
    "And we wondering",
    "Battant pour nos vie",
    "We patiently wait for some other day",
    "That's too far away so right now I say",
    "When I get older, I will be stronger",
    "They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag",
    "And then it goes back, and then it goes back",
    "And then it goes back",
    "When I get older, I will be stronger",
    "They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag",
    "And then it goes back, and then it goes back",
    "And then it goes back",
    "How come when the media stops covering",
    "And there's a little help from the government",
    "We forget about the people still struggling",
    "And assume that its really all love again, nah",
    "See we don't have to wait for things to break apart",
    "If you weren't involved before, it's never too late to start",
    "You probably think that it's too far to even have to care",
    "Well, take a look at where you live, what if it happened there?",
    "You have to know the urge to make a change lies within",
    "And we can be the reason that they see their flag rise again",
    "When I get older, I will be stronger",
    "They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag",
    "And then it goes back",
    "And then it goes back",
    "Then it goes back",
    "When I get older, I will be stronger",
    "They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag",
    "And then it goes back, and then it goes back",
    "And then it goes back",
    "When I get older, when I get older",
    "I will be stronger, just like a waving flag"
