    "Why won't my tears work? It's been a decade since I've cried",
    "I got no dog left in the fight",
    "The bark don't match the bite",
    "Me and my old man, we just get fucked up every night",
    "He said, \"Son, these hoes just don't love you\"",
    "I said, \"I'll keep that in mind\"",
    "Those ain't words to live by, wouldn't call that sound advice",
    "Our future doesn't sound too bright",
    "But I just nod and say, \"You're right,\" I do",
    "Girl, I can't decide if I should stay and say I tried",
    "Or I should leave and say goodbye",
    "It's killin' me inside",
    "And all my (My) presents to show my affection",
    "Flowers and diamonds and jets through the sky",

    "I prayed to her from time to time",
    "She was busy on another vibe",
    "I can't vent to you through no text message and reply",
    "I need to see you face to face",
    "Gotta look you in the eye, I do",
    "Girl, I can't decide if I should stay and say I tried",
    "Or I should leave and say goodbye",
