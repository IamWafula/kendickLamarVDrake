Mi no hablo\nMe drown sorrow in that Diablo\nMe found bravery in my bravado\nDJs need to listen to the models\nYou ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato? (You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)\nStupid, but what the hell do I know?\nI'm just a Chi-Town nigga with a Nas flow\nAnd my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo\nSo much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Justin Vernon]\nCan we get much higher? (Higher, higher, higher)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nOooh!\nLook like a fat booty Celine Dion\nSex is on fire, I'm the King of Leona Lewis\nBeyond the truest\nHey, teacher, teacher, tell me how do you respond to students?\nAnd refresh the page and restart the memory?\nRe-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?\nWe stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy\nSorry for the night demons that still visit me\nThe plan was to drink until the pain over\nBut what's worse, the pain or the hangover?\nFresh air, rollin' down the window\nToo many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low\nDon't make me pull the toys out, huh\nDon't make me pull the toys\nAnd fire up the engines\nAnd then they make noise\n\n[Chorus: Justin Vernon]\nCan we get much higher? (Higher, higher, higher)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)\n\n\n\n[Bridge: Justin Vernon & Kanye West]\nAt the mall, there was a seance\nJust kids, no parents\nThen the sky filled with herons\nSaw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron\nAnd the hell, it wouldn't spare us\nAnd the fires did declare us\nBut after that, took pills, kissed an heiress\nAnd woke up back in Paris\n\n[Chorus: Justin Vernon]\nCan we get much higher? (Higher, higher, higher)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh\nCan we get much higher? (Higher, higher, higher)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)\nOh\n\n[Interlude 1]\n\n[Newscaster Woman, on the television]\n- The company is introducing [unintelligible] strategies for the middling European market. Last year the company profited 340-million euros, which was a 5-percent raise. Fires are raging today, causing major damage in the local area forests. The specific cause is believed to be a comet that landed in the forests starting these fires. Local fire departments are working hard to control this situation.
