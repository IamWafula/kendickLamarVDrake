    "When love was found",
    "I kept my hope just like I'd hoped to",
    "Then sang to the sea for feelings deep blue",
    "Comin' down",
    "And we've had problems that we've grown through",
    "But I bet you dream of what you could do",
    "At seventeen I was alright",
    "Was like nothin' I could feel inside",
    "And wishing you were here tonight is like holdin' on",
    "But I still get to see your face, right?",
    "And that's like nothin' they can take, right?",
    "So there won't be no feelin' in the firelight",
    "Hopin' this will be right",
    "Time to show your worth, child",
    "I remember when her heart broke over stubborn shit",
    "That's no way to be livin', kid",
    "The angel of death is ruthless",
    "And I'm always thinkin' summertime with the bikes out",
    "Pushing our luck getting wiped out",
    "Days with nothin' but laughin' loud",
    "Underneath my coat, won't you tap my shoulder, hold my hand?",
    "Nights with nothin' but dark in there",
    "You can be my armor then",
    "Island smiles and cardigans",
    "The nights that we've been drinkin'",
    "And we're here to help you kill all of this hurt that you've been harborin'",
    "Confessions should be better planned",
    "Alone, that night, I'm surely damned",
    "Run away and I'll understand it",
    "What's important is this evenin' I will not forget",
    "Purple, blue, orange, red",
    "These colors of feelin'",
    "Give me love, I'll put my heart in it",
    "And I think about it all the time",
    "The lights went out, you were fine",
    "You kinda struggle not to shine",
    "I still love you, though",
    "I still love you, though",
    "I still love you always",
    "So hold me when I'm home, keep the evenings long",
    "Crack and break and part ways",
    "I still love you, though",
    "I still love you, though",
    "I still love you always",
    "So hold me when I'm home, keep the evenings long",
    "Let's not crack and break and part ways",
    "And I wonder if I could let her down",
    "Somewhere between \"psychotic\" and \"iconic\"",
    "Somewhere between \"I want it\" and \"I got it\"",
    "Somewhere between \"I'm sober\" and \"I'm lifted\"",
    "Somewhere between \"a mistress\" and \"commitment\"",
    "But I stay down, girl I always stay down, get down, never lay down",
    "Promise to break everybody off before I break down",
    "Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now",
    "People I believed in, they don't even show they face now",
    "What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now",
    "Nothin' really changed, but still they look at me a way now",
    "What more can I say now? What more can I say now?",
    "You might feel like nothin' was the same",
    "And I've still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low",
    "Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low",
    "I've still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low",
    "The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know, yeah",
    "And I hate that you don't think I belong to you",
    "Just too busy runnin' this to run home to you",
    "You know that paper my passion",
    "Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened",
    "I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish",
    "I made every woman feel like she were mine and no one else's",
    "Now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop frontin', I can't take it",
    "Girl, don't treat me like a stranger, girl, you know I've seen you naked",
    "Girl, you know that I remember, don't be a pretender",
    "Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together",
    "You know I stay reminiscin' and make-up sex is tradition",
    "But you've been missin', girl",
    "And you might feel like nothin' was the same",
    "And I've still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low",
    "Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low",
    "I've still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low",
    "The furthest thing from perfect",
    "And I wonder if I could let her down",
    "It's for real, it's for real",
    "It's for real, it's for real"
