You crazy? Are you loco, nigga? If she put a long tan hat on she'd look like a cigarette.\"\n\n[Intro]\nTa-ha\nJersey\nUh\n[?] I'm on it\nWhat us Jers? Clue, what up?\nE, what up?\n[?] real quick, check me out now, look\n\n[Verse]\nShout to all my fans, glad I can inspire y'all\nGot a couple haters, still tryna acquire more\nAin't gotta be abrupt\nI tell em' like I tell my girl, you doing a great job, now keep it up\nAnd I promise I'll take you higher then you ever seen\n40 milligram flow, chased by Promethazine\n\nLack of competitors, yappin' 'bout etcetera\nCan't tell if I'm listening to rappers or treasurers\nAnd as a poet I feel like I owe it not to go astray\nSo everything inside me Ginuwine, no Solé\n\nYou gotta blame it on my upbringing\nIt goes back to when Tyrese was on the bus singing\n\nYeah, I guess that's why shorty's attracted to me\nSelf-made style, the label ain't attach it to me\nAside from when she comes through I get her ribs in order\nAnd the neighbors would know my name if the crib was smaller\n\nBut no groupies, them walls are windows\nThe basement is the movies, pool by the jacuzzi\nThe hallways echo, the closet is a bedroom\nThe sauna fits five comfortably, plenty leg room\nLike the La Montagne Carwash in the garage\nShe from the projects so she thinks it's a mirage\nTold her I got my own concierge (But)\nShe was more impressed that she could do her laundry here\nBut all I'm tryna do is bust her, Flipmode\n\nProblem is I think she seen too many flicks though\nShe said she'd only be impressed by a diamond ring (Or)\nOr if I had a hot tub that's a time machine\n\nThese bloggers'll have you thinkin' that I'm abnormal\nSo when you read it can't say that I ain't try to warn you\nI respond so mature, so unlike Joe\nWhat they write though is all wrong, just a typo\nI just learned to be alone without an Iso\nAll a nigga gotta do is take the high road\nTwo words for my enemies: die slow\nFull-time pyro', could do this with my eyes closed\nThey say you doin' something wrong if all the critics love you\nFor some it's a career, for some it's just a hustle\nMe, all I do is win, that begins\nWith not rockin' my Lebrons 'less the nigga got a triple-double (Talk to 'em)\nBefore youse rap dudes put me in ya verse\nAssess your situation, picture it being worse\nYou askin' to get fucked, how could you not assume\nIt's like inviting Ricky Martin in a locker room\n\nHip-Hop just a journey\nMost number one seeds got clipped just like the tourney\n\nIf it don't involve myself, then it really don't concern me\nChea"
