    "Uh, uh",
    "It's 10 o'clock on a Wednesday and I know you're home",
    "Drivin' up and down your street",
    "Hopin' that you'll come outside",
    "'Cause I just got paid and I went and bought the car you wanted",
    "And I just need you to see me",
    "Childish as it seems, it'll make it all better, better",
    "Selfish as it is, this just ain't about you no",
    "Did me wrong every time we were together, -gether",
    "And that's why",
    "I'm gonna stunt on you",
    "I'm gonna stunt on you",
    "You let me go, little did you know",
    "I could've made it all on my own"
