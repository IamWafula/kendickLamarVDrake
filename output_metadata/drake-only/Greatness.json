    "I wrote this verse sittin' in my new car",
    "Sometimes where you headed is too far",
    "It’s more about where you are",
    "And I am, everywhere where that you wish you could be",
    "Somebody, somewhere just really understood me",
    "Yeah, I dream big, no false hope",
    "My other niggas move keys, no off notes",
    "But understand rich is how we're all ending up",
    "I’m at the label in the elevator, send 'em up!"
