Man, you know we stay down\nAnd I’m an honorary resident in UGK town\nI’m on my way, yeah, I'm on my way\nI never give a fuck about what any nigga say\nThe music all slow and the bitches all pretty\nMe and Pimp about to do it for the city in this thing\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nWhat up? What up?\nH-Town in this bitch\nWhat up? What up?\nMe and Pimp about to do it for the city\nWhat up? What up?\nWhat up? What up?\n\n[Verse 2: Pimp C]\nMoney by the ton, bricks from crumbs\nMillionaire from nothing, mind on hustlin'\nPussy’s a commodity, but dick sell better\nThem dickies and high shoes to a cashmere sweater\nPaint done got wetter than it was in '94\nThe drink that got thicker and the dirt weed rolled\n'96 Impala with the stick on the floor\nNow its Bentley Four Doors with patron on the doors\nLight wood, nigga, Polo, fuck Hilfiger\nJammin' Slim Thug, know them belly fully of drugs\nYoung hard nigga, underdog nigga\nYellow lights on the rocker through the fall, pussy nigga\nYellow diamonds on my finger, playing in the car\nMy dick wanna fuck but my pockets say, \"Stop\"\nNot 'cause they empty, I’m just greedy for some more\nI need some more dough, I’ma P-I-M-P for sure\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nWhat up? What up?\nH-Town in this bitch\nWhat up? What up?\nMe and Pimp about to do it for the city\nWhat up? What up?\nWhat up? What up?\n\n[Verse 3: Bun B]\nWell it's the Trill OG, I got the neighbourhood soul\nKush is dead Im getting blowed, riding bangin getting throwed\nIn the candy painted low, Chrome grill in front of it\nBelts on the back of it, my chrome hearts shoes running it\nAnd shorty on the side of me is straight up off the king cover\nDon’t care what anybody say long as the King love her\nWish I could tell her that I dont but it would kill her\nI just keep on grippin' grains drippin' stains\nBeing trilla ain't another brother realer\nBlowing thousand dollar killer\nWith the Filipino flow that I just got it from Manila\nBout to snow up in my city\nSo let me put on my chincilla\nIn the ‘rari doing donuts like my name was J Dilla\n\nAll about the skrilla so just point me to the dealer\nKeep the work up in the attic and the money in the cellar\nYour girl up in the second automatics for the fella’s\nYou see us in the back than all you gotta do is tell us\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nWhat up? What up?\nH-Town in this bitch\nWhat up? What up?\nMe and Pimp about to do it for the city\nWhat up? What up?\nWhat up? What up?"
