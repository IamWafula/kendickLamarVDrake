    "You've got to change your evil ways, if you wanna keep that",
    "Yeah, I got some evil ways",
    "Even through the glasses, you can see the gaze",
    "To find your way up to the top, this shit gon' be a maze",
    "Volkswagen, shit the way I'm runnin' Beatles' plays",
    "Yeah, and we linkin' like we freed the slaves",
    "I conquered hell, I walked the 'Ville and set my feet ablaze",
    "My heart hardens every year like sneakers that Adidas made",
    "I never did the VMAs, I'm not in need of praise",
    "All praise to the born sinners Jesus saves",
    "My brothers running through the six like the green berets",
    "Beefin' with a block that's five hundred feet away",
    "Wheel of fortune, shit, the way they say they need a K",
    "Nah, ooh, I only need a raise",
    "And a safe to stash these Frito Lays",
    "Times was hard, I watched my mama robbing Paul just to get Peter paid",
    "And now my paper folded",
    "Like when teachers don't want classmates to see your grade",
    "Time is speedin' now, I see the greys pokin' out this beard",
    "But it's weird 'cause I feel like I ain't even age (yeah)",
    "Y'all seize the rage",
    "Feet firmly planted for these precious flowers I've been handed",
    "Watch me be the vase",
    "Man, I'm livin' out Carlito's way",
    "You niggas ain't gettin' no bread, you in a keto phase",
    "Wisdom comin' out my mouth like some teethin' pain",

    "Zopiclone baby, I can't rest without the sleepin' aids",
    "Bought this nigga jewels, these shits is light",
    "Let's get it reappraised",
    "I bet you see the price and you gon' be amazed",
    "And broski didn't do it, he like a piece of art, judge, he was framed",
    "Some feed the J's to receive a wage",
    "Coke got they nose bleedin'",
    "Like the seats where you can't see the stage",
    "High up in arenas where they see their faves",
    "AKA me and Drizzy Drake, we the wave",
    "Uh, yeah, we the wave",
    "Like Christian Combs with a brush in his hand once the grease is laid",
    "Shit is 360 like the label deal you signed to get your people paid",
    "Me, I got tickets like a meter maid",
    "And 21 my nigga like he celebrate a legal age",
    "Next time I get in Rosalia face",
    "I hope she tell her people that we need some space",
    "Niggas think I won't get 'em hit",
    "But like an Indian marriage, it could be arranged",
    "Diss me, and you just may see us on your block like the street parade",
    "At the top, playin' keep away with the crown",
    "Our life's an open book, come and read a page",
    "Drake pulled a white bitch that's goin' both ways",
    "She like the queen of spades",
    "I'm startin' to think they percs is fake, they weed is laced",
    "For thinkin' it's a game",
    "If it's a game, these streets would be the Bushido's Blade",
    "Razor to his face and he ain't need a shave",
    "I stay out of beef, see niggas' DNA get rearranged",
    "I'm with Drizzy in Atlanta, so many hitters with that nigga",
    "They could be the Braves",
    "Young angel goin' through his demon phase",
    "Hard to blame 'em, Lord knows this game could be depraved",
    "Scary Hours undefeated, y'all should be afraid",
    "Yeah, y'all should be afraid",
    "Ooh, ways, if you wanna keep that guy",
    "You've got to change your evil ways, if you wanna keep that",
    "Oh, baby, be honest with yourself",
    "There's some things in life and you know",
    "Ooh, ways, if you wanna to keep that guy",
