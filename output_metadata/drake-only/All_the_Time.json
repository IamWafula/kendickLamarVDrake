    "Why can't you love me like I need you to?",
    "It's such a simple task at hand",
    "Well you can't cure a broken man",
    "Or mend his gun hot hands",
    "And I am still the same kid you fell for when we were young",
    "How come every song I sing you say has already been sung?",
    "And I feel like a nuisance in my own damn mind",
    "When I speak you say it's too much, when I scream you say I've lost my mind",
    "So don't call in the mornin' 'cause I'll already be gone",
    "Oklahoma in the summertime's where my country ass belongs",
    "Love is patient, love is kind",
    ", should not make you lose your mind",
    "Thеre's got to be more to this than bеin' pissed off all the time",
    "All the time",
    "Why can't I love you like you need me to?",
    "It seems we just oppose",
    "I'll just head out on the town for deja vu until they close",
    "So don't call in the mornin' 'cause I'll already be gone",
    "Oklahoma in the summertime's where my country ass belongs",
    "Love is patient, love is kind, should not make you lose your mind",
    "There's got to be more to this than bein' pissed off all the time",
    "All the time",
    "So don't call in the mornin' 'cause I'll already be gone",
    "Oklahoma in the summertime's where my country ass belongs",
    "Love is patient, love is kind, should not make you lose your mind",
    "There's got to be more to this than bein' pissed off all the time"
