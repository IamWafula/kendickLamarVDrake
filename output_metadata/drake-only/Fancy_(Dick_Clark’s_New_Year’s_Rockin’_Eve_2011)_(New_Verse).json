(You gotcha)\nNail done, hair done, everything did\nNa-na-nails done, hair done, everything did (Oh)\nOh, you fancy, huh?\n\n[Interlude: Drake, Swizz Beatz & Choir]\nLA, let me see your hands\nTelling that the night [?]\nAnd she bought it, let 'em know that everything big\nNails done, hair done, everything big (Oh)\nAll my LA girls, let me see your hands (Ayy)\nNew year's eve you can leave up and bring a friend\nAnd she bought it, let 'em know that everything big\nNails done, hair done, nails done, hair done\nAll my LA girls, let me see your hands (All my LA girls)\nAll my LA girls (Put your nails done, right)\nAll my LA girls (All my LA girls)\nAll my LA girls (Put your hair done, right)\nAll my LA girls (All my LA girls)\nAll my LA girls (All my LA girls)\nAll my LA girls\nLet 'em know that everything big (All my LA girls)\nNails done, hair done, nails done, hair done\n\n\n\n[Verse: Drake]\nFinally back in Toronto, it's better here\nI just wanna be anywhere but everywhere\nI'm being lazy at the crib kushin' it up\nI get enough exercise just pushing my luck\nSitting back thinking, damn, where did they go?\nThey used to be the ones to watch Ricki Lake show\nAnd now I see 'em picking up the pieces\nOne too many starting over speeches\nI guess, it’s back to me like it always was\nMe and the OVO set like it always was\nA little money on the counter I left for my girl\nWith a note I’m trying to see the rest of the world\nIt all looked so amazing when we are growing up\nUsed to sit back and say I know I’ll get a model one day\n\nBut all the money and the rap game slow as fuck\n\nAnd all the models from the hood, Project Runway\nYeah, it’s whatever\nYou know, feeling good, living better\nBut it’s evident that nothing can prepare us for certain moments that you just gotta cherish\nLike this young girl had my lyrics tatted on her arm last night\nWe took a picture together, I hope she frames it\nAnd I was drinking at the Palms last night\nAnd ended up losing everything that I came with, yeah\nFeel like I been here before, huh?\n\nYeah, I still got ten years to go, huh?\nThis is the only sound you should fear\nMan these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & Drake]\nOh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?\nOh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh? (You gotcha)\nNails done, hair done, everything did\nNa-na-nails done, hair done, everything did\nOh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?\nOh, you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy, huh? (You gotcha)\nNails done, hair done, everything did\nNa-na-nails done, hair done, everything did (Oh)\nOh, you fancy, huh?\n\n[Outro: Drake]\nAll my LA girls\nThis go out to all my LA girls\nI said, all my LA girls\nHappy new year"
