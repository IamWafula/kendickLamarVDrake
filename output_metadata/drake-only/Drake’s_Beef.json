I was wondering if you knew how to fix it\nOh yeah, usually you just get the remote and you press \"On\"! What, they don't have TV's in Canada?\nNo, we- we have TV's in Canada\nOh, I was just- I know, I was just kidding. I was just kidding, man\nYeah, I know\nYeah, I was just saying, like I don't use the word \"cray\" very often, but I used it and it got such a great response\n\n[Verse 1: Drake]\nYo, fuck you Pete, you made a fool outta me\nI used to trust you dog, now you embarrassing me\nAnd you skinny as hell, and you make me mad\nYou think you funny, huh? Well you ain't Josh Gad\nAnd your tattoos suck, you're the guy no one likes\nWe used to be best friends, now we foes for life\nDamn\n\n[Skit 2: Drake & Leslie Jones]\nWhat's up, Leslie?\nHuh?\nNo, I was just saying- I was like “What's up, Leslie?\"\nAye, man, I'm sorry, I was just distracted. Check you later\n\n\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nOh, you icing me nigga? What did I do to you?\nYou used to be my best friend, now I'll never trust you\nIs it the stuff that I said? 'Cause if not, then that's wack\nMost people I know, they would've said \"Hi\" back\nDamn\n\n[Skit 3: Aidy Bryant]\nHey, anybody using this chair?\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nActually, I was you bitch, it was for my hat\nBut you took it from me, now we never going back\nI could never trust you, 'cause you were rude to my hat\nIf Josh Gad was here, he would've made me laugh\nDamn\n\n[Skit 4: Drake]\nHi there. Oh, I actually wasn't done\n\n[Verse 4: Drake]\nI said I wasn't done you little fucking ice cream\nI had like 10 sips left, you just so damn mean\nNow I got no friends, and I got no water\nAnd I lost my hat?\nDamn\n\n\n\n[Skit 5: Lorne Michaels & Drake]\nDrizzy, how's it going?\nOh man, I feel like- I feel like it's going great, yeah\nYou're doing a good job\n\n[Verse 5: Drake]\n\"Good job,\" that's it? I'm doing great, you bitch\nSay that again to my face, nigga, suck my dick\n\n[Skit 6: Lorne Michaels & Drake]\nDrake, everything okay?\nUh, yeah, yeah. Everyone's so nice here, you know?\n\n[Outro]\n6ix"
