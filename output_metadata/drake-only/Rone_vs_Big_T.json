All the way from Philadelphia, rapper to my right, introduce yourself\n\n[Rone]\nMan, you seen me in the fucking streets. You seen me in the ring. Rone Baby the Prince, soon to be the King. Let's fucking go, baby! Let's fucking go\n\n[Organik]\nAll the way from Chicago, making his Toronto debut, battler to my left, introduce yourself\n\n[Big T]\nBuck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck! Let's go. Y'all ready?\n\n[Organik]\nYeah. Rone won the coin toss. Big T, let's get it\n\n[Round 1: Big T]\nBig Terrance!\nI never seen 'em say \"Adam\" and make the crowd large\nSee I didn't ask for this\nOrganik picked, that's a wild card\nJust send me a couple thou' large and he a dead man, how smart?\nYou get Terrance and Phillip fo' sho(w) in Canada like South Park\nNow start\nAin't you from Grind Time New York?\nNow don't nobody even see you in a battle\nI get money in the garden, I don't think Adam even eating in The Apple\nGarden, Adam, Eve and Eden and the apple?\nThat's the only time y'all gonna hear me repeating in this battle\nI run up on him with Glock ah...\nI can't do that type style\nI touch that nigga whipping the ra...\nNot in this King Of The Dot crowd\nFuck that\nShalock, boom boom, blocka, blocka, BOW!\nI came in this game making Glock sounds and I ain't gonna stop now!\nY'all got Mr. Chickalaboo back in Canada\nI'm Mr. Psss Ting/poutine, silencer on it, TING! Dllalat dat doo get\n1 in cannon I use routines\nThat was a reach but I'm reaching for two things when I'm shooting\nDumping it\nSwitch it up like a mood ring during a mood swing, you king?\nYou king?\nI heard you was selling coke in college to all with your rich white friends\nShit, I walk up to you like, \"Hi guys.\" Giving hi fives, I'll fit right in\nLearning all of they connections on how they sneak white in\nThen come to/two body they connects like Siamese twins\nFriends?\nWhat could this guy do?\nThis guy is food\nAll I need is the laces on my shoe\nOne call, pa-poo\nAll you hear is \"ahh ooh\"\nI make a call and Tyrone/tie Rone up like Erykah Badu\nYou better call Tyrone\nCause the respirator gonna look like you telling the truth on the operator\nFlatline\nWhen I stop doing gun sounds?\nUnlikely, never\nHe good...but you better hope the doctors better\nCause I'ma give him the toast, they taking Patronshots together\nGet at 'em/Adam for the people I sent at 'em to get Adam\nI'm breaking Adam/atom down until Adam is broken down into atoms\nLike, where your kids Adam?\nI'm sick Adam\nI'll have my dogs sic Adam\nYou know why Pat used to bitch Adam?\nCause he started his Facebook page and he didn't add him\nLike...forget Adam, don't Facebook, call or Tweet at him\nI'll beat the shit out him, I'll point that M at 'em\nNow get ma'dam, I don't if I was Eve\nI'm stepping back from the plate like they throwing a pitch at 'em\nPoint the sig at 'em, remove his ribs out 'em\nLike God did Adam!\nWhat you want?\nSyllable rhymes?\nMan the simple it's fun\nThat's easy like a Christian or nun reading a scripture or songs\nThere's two pistols on me, boom, boom, empty the gun\nThe other one I raise without a care like an illegitimate son\nDidn't you say, \"Black people don't raise they children?\"\nYou racist Nazi fag\nGuess what, I was raised by my mom and dad\nLike, I'm cool with black people\nThat's until they driving fast get off in traffic and call 'em a \"nigga\" when they driving past\nWhen Daylyt was doing that Pat Stay, whipping the weirdest shit\nYou and 24/7 was the only people cheering and shit\nShit, cheers and shit\nSlapping beers and shit\nLike that's the best Daylyt we seen all year and shit\nTIME!\n\n\n\n[Round 1: Rone]\nSo Organik hit my phone up!\nAbout this battle with T\nWell he Facebook messaged me and I texted him and he told me to call\nYou know...international fees\nBut Organik hit my phone up!\nI was taking orders and blazing quarters, he said, \"How 'bout T?\"\nI said, \"He's outdated as a tape recorder\"\nI said, \"What about Pat? What about Shots?\nI exhausted a lengthy order\nThen I said, \"All right T then\" I was sounding like Ace Ventura\n\nSo I took...T...on\nFlipped the switch and then tee...off\nLike tee ball or a tee box, you a Scrub go ask T-Boz\nOh that's the T?\nThe audacity\nBrutality\nCalamity\nYou'll get all that from me\nRoyce? 50? They could go H.A.M. with me\nI got a profanity for any pro fan of T\nYour girl don't engage in honesty\nIf she say the only man that she on is T\nSo you need some friendship, some humanity\nBut you look like a sea creature, you manatee\nThey doubted I could pass a T\nLike I don't have the capacity\nBut you'll get stretched like a legra tee\nAnd I could do that with alacrity\nThis shit gon' be a travesty\nWhen I kill your ass in front of Travis, T\nSo bring half of your team or relax against me\nAnd that's a sure fire way to make a casualty\nSo I heard you almost got signed to Shady Records\nTheir whole staff been partial\nSo you flipped out on your Chicago shit\nLike, \"What you gonna do for my brand then Marshall?\"\nSo they skipped him cause guys rowdy\nNow I'm collecting my bounty\nI'm from Philly but I run this show in Toronto, I'm Kyle Lowry\n\nBut you second in your city Terry\nThat's why they call you Pippen, Terry\nAnd to say you don't get women Terry\nThat don't take a visionary\nI mean, we could find a Mormon tourist in Europe and you still couldn't hit it missionary\nNo one wants to see your Bear/bare ass\nThat's exactly why you single Terry/Singletary\n\nBut if beef...what you're facing Terry\nYou'll get rocked like a mason Terry (Masonary)\nAnd if they wind up chasing Terry\nHe gon' Jet like he Jason Terry\nBut I could keep it on Chicago shit\nLike where Urlacher played\nWe could think, Sammy Sosa, a sosa who packed his 'cane\nOr I could him on ice faster than Patrick Kane\nThen grab some more rice [?] that are in Patrick's chain\nYou got no H for jabbing veins\nYou ain't slinging crack cocaine\nYou ain't seen a brick or a nic' since Patrick played\nYou ain't have Blue Magic since Magic contracted AIDS\n\nYou wouldn't draw on me if I was half a page of anime\nYou wouldn't draw on me if I was a connect the dots handout\nYou wouldn't draw on me if I was passed out in a frat house\nI mean...\nYou have an imprint in your fat from the weapon on your waist\nWhen you smile, it looks like your lips are being stretched across your face\nYou fucked up on Total Slaughter because of the glares of everyone there\nLet me guess, it wasn't the first time you couldn't take the stares/stairs\nAnd when I heard you got shot...I got jealousssssss\nI mean, I'm glad you're not out on the streets dead\nBut if I got popped with a couple shots it would do wonders for my street cred'\nI mean, who knew the Michelin Man was from Michigan Ave?\nToo tired to walk, too fat to sit in the cab\nAnd this is dinner for me\nTo you dinner's a snack\nYou got me G? Colostomy, I got this shit in the bag\nBro, after these fireworks, he'll be calling up life alert\nGetting a ride to church, reading his favorite Bible verse\nHis wife will squirt and then leave him after I make him bite the curb\nHe'll get a career and have to wear a Hawaiian shirt and tie to work\nAnd the boss at his new office\nI bet he, ain't gon' fuck around\nSo you'll have to change your name from Big T to Big Button Down\nAnd what kind of future is that?\nWhat kind of lose is that?\nWhen you're forever known as \"The dudes who's fat who used to rap.\"\nQuiet, let's go bitch\n\n\n\n[Round 2: Big T]\n{Big T snoring}\nI fell asleep in my last round\nIt felt like I was in the camel clutch\nWhere Drake at?\nCause I'd a ask him, I didn't hear it but, did he land a punch?\nMy bad, I'm just saying that I'm being real with him\nI don't got that feel with him like Lil' Wayne...Baby\nIf it wasn't for that Cash Money I wouldn't want to deal with him\nThat long round but I'm still winning\nI put your face on the ground\nI send you to a land of angels, halos and clouds\nOh, everybody in shotgun think it's a game\nUntil now I get mad and intercept a bullet\nThat's when the whole game turn around\nWelcome me back\nBut I'm at the King Of The Dot pissing on welcoming mats\nAye, what's your obsession with battling black rappers from Smack?\nLike it's suppose to help you progress up in rap\nYou say \"black people don't raise their children.\"\nYou saying it's a fact\nBut another fact is that battle with Pat was gay as fuck\nAnd ain't no questioning that\nI teach you How To Be A Player, where Bill Bellamy at?\nI'm sexy and fat\nYo, why you and Pat keep texting me that?\nBullets invest in a Mac, fuck loading a clip\nIt's like I could load a jet ski in that\nWayne Gretsky is back\nSlide on this bitch like I'm trying strike a match\nBut she never wipe her snatch\nHer puss smell like something crawled up and died in that\nThank God I'm back\nBattle rap crisis back, beat me?\nIt's like women's rights activists signing a petition to make Ray Rice come back\nI'm nice at that\nAnd I pull up to the light it seems\nGo 'head you want to fight but I don't do the Tyson thing\nI'd rather pull up in a whip, FIRING\nAll you see is that bitch, pop out a TV like The Ring\nStyle on 'em\nYou see T at Penn State with a fifth of Jaegermeister\nHalf pint of drank provider\nFrom one of Drake's suppliers\nSnoop Dogg vaporizers\nSpray this guy and have a K hole tranquilizer\nBefore they announce that pussy with a W and I ain't imitating Plies\nYou ain't as nice as mine\nTrying to rhyme in this column and I'm like Columbine\nA life's demise\nEverybody you like were guys\nI still got the steel on the side like Johnny 5\nTwo nine's on me Mike and Live on 99\nDon't style in this\nI'll beat your Mobb Deep underground, Alchemist\nThis trigger finger?\nIt start developing callus\nIt don't work out/workout, paralysis\nIf he move it's miraculous\nClips? I load a spear in it, Goldberg tackle us\nWe're savages, blood drinking Draculas\nI bet your idea of an Ebola vaccine is\n\"America need to stop letting those damn Africans\"\nYou want cold war?\nI'm a cold war practition- quiet!\n\n\n\n[Round 2: Rone]\nThat was a cool little round bro\nReally I'm not that mad at you\n...mad at cha\nAt the beginning of the round you were snoring\nThat's called sneep apnea\n(Sleep apena\nI gotta learn how to talk)\nFuck spitting for a civil war I'm dicking up your chicken raw\nI'm longer than the pinafore\n and stronger than a Minotaur\nWhat you want friction for?\nI'm savage as the Chickasaw\nHe gonna show where them cans is/Kansas?\nIt's a road trip to Wichita\nIf you got the heart for this, a double dose of Lipitor\nIf you on the block then it's Madden with the Brickasaw\nAnd I ain't talking Ferguson and I ain't popping shots\nSo what you mad at me for dawg? Man I'm not the cops\nBut I can play the judge for this irrelevant geek\nCause if Eric Gardner chokes you won't hear a sentence from me\nI mean...\nI'd love to kill him on a beautiful Sunday like today\nCaskets up with the bouquet\nOr maybe get him on the next day, have him stuffed in a suitcase\nAnd if I can't get him then, I give a fuck what your dude's say\nHe'll be just like Makonnen going up on a Tuesday\nI'm fucking...\nYou souffle soft, I'll fillet you for loose change, you're too gay\nFucking get booked, you would sing off keys, that's fucking Robert Goulet\nI'm Bobby Boucher\nPacking a hatchet the Sioux made\nI'll fucking scalp 'em and sell them dreads as a fucking toupee\nWhat to do with this nerd?\nTakes an unusual verse\nHow to befuddle a spitter who makes music with words\nBut I'm from Philly, you know I fuck with the root of the...\nThe fucking word of The Roots\nBut today I think I kill him with the root of the words\nSee I've never been im-pressed\nIt's nothing I'll im-ply\nMy raps make him in-vest\nYou barely get in-vites, I don't say it in jest\nI'll still put you in flight\nYou're the shit that they ig-nore\nMy shit make 'em ig-nite dawg\nIf you in court you raising your in-dex\nIf you in deep you probably gon' in-dite\nOnly whore on-line you spinning on Pintrest\nYou never been a gangster who's cutting them pin stripes\nBut when I spit my shit it's cleaner than Win-dex\nBut he can't even [?] cause his chunky ass wind pipe\nSo I don't give a fuck if he out from the mid-west\nHis delivery is as gentle as a fucking midwife\nBro I can't even hang with T cause son's stressing\nHe thinks everything is a drug or a gun reference\nLike I said, \"Molly, Miley and Nina's in the back of the whip.\"\nHe said, \"Pills, coke and a nine?\" I said, \"No. Actual chicks.\"\nIf I say \"Crystal and Mary Jane\" he ain't thinking names of women\nIf I fucking talk about my cell plan\nHe's thinking about escapes from prison\nListen\nIf I say \"ratchets\" I'm talking about tools\nIf I say \"cans\" I'm talking about booze\nIf I'm gon' ride it's probably a cruise\nIf I got white it's the sock in my shoes\nBut you acting like your squads snapping\nYou all wood like a log cabin\nAnd that big arm like Tom Savage\nBut my strategy is John Madden\nYou got sound effects in your rounds well then homie you should stop rapping\nWe in Toronto, Capo, leave it to Scott Jackson\nBut I mean...\nBut, but me and T...fucking...\nDid brawl once the fucking sound effects were crazy\nWe fucking went all out it was right in front of his lady\nI mean he came out with that chic chic trying to let that big thing ring\nBut I came back with the sword I was like shwing shwing shwing\n\n[Round 3: Big T]\nUno Lavos wouldn't cross the boarder to get work from you and he Mexican, that's messed up\nJ.C. wouldn't dance in the ring with you\nE.Ness wouldn't give the Bandz up\nSo you saying stuff like, \"Why these black people wanna battle me?\"\nMan shut the hell up\nYou like Brad Pitt in Fight Club\nThey got you out here looking crazy beating yourself up\nHelp us?\nWhat happened when [?] at your dome?\nIt was your black friends buddy that stood up like, \"Leave that kid alone!\"\nSee, you didn't care if our dads weren't at home\nTheir loyalty was like your real name\nIf needed them fam to get 'em/Adam for Rone\nDamn wigger\nYou lying in your voice\nYou playing Simba\nYour N.W.A. CD skip last night at the hotel and I heard you saying \"nigga\"\nI heard you, you was saying \"nigga\"\nScalp you with a scalpel, approach me and I'm spraying ya\nHave Adam's apple surgically removed like a transgender\nYou a puss homes\nThat battle with Pay Stay wasn't gay, it just look wrong\nLike, are y'all fucking for real?\nNo, are y'all fucking for real?\nHe had you took home\nYou talking loud, that silencer on that {chic chic} clone\nWithout tux, you finally get a tie or two to match\nWhen I go at Pat Stay and Rone it's on\nIt's time to stop the show\nBreaking news\nI knew you was going to come with the typical practical jokes\nApril Fools\nI'm spraying tools the rules that the Navy use\nBut this ain't what it's taking to\nYou gonna come to get popped, Taken 2\nSave the ooohs\nThis round, I take the boos\nI'm playing in school like oooh, \"he got them new Jordan 2s? Let's take his shoes.\"\nWe got older, put mother and daughter in a sacred room\nOne live, one die nigga, make 'em choose!\nFuck it, kill yourself for all I know\nI point that can' at her, that big boy is Ontario\nBut there ain't no where to run though\nNow that was a reach, I ain't gon' lie\nBut I'm reaching for another gun pronto\nDrake Started From The Bottom beat, you gon' get it from Mahalo (a hollow)\nSee, we all know a whole bunch of shit that you could say about me\nIf I was you, I'd have all my shit took away\nYou could say\n\"Big T, what you know about studying for a test that's a month away?\nYou had to go to school, your dad made you read a book a day\nThe whole book a day\nNo B's, you only could get A's\nCause if you didn't get good grades you got all your privileges took away.\"\nYou could be like, \"Big T\nWhat you know about being mad when McNabb couldn't play\nCause if it was a mistake my dad used to beat my mom ass and I had to look away.\"\nLike, \"He didn't mean to fumble that last play it was a mistake.\"\nAll you hear is {bbbbbrrr bbbbrrr clap clap} \"Leave her alone dad for goodness sakes!\"\nWhat you know about Adam having the same face as mine\nCause I'm Adam junior and he's Adam senior he had the same face as mine\nSo if I lose the disgrace is mine\nSo first place was mine cause you had somebody there to motivate you every time\nI wouldn't know about that\nQUIET nigga!\n\n[Verse 3: Rone]\nYo, check\nSo I worried they'd paint me simply if fat jokes were all I'd bring for T\nBut he's the first really fat guy I've battled, so...this is big for me\nI mean, these fat jokes are mad heavy, y'all might get mad at me\nShit, I might lose all my fat friends—oh, wait, I don't have any\nSo if regular fat people wear big tees with their bathing suits\nYou take the next level and probably bathe in suits\nI mean, I'd clown him about his outfit, but his face looks like it's drowning\nYou don't have a lazy eye, you have a lazy face around it\nYou look like the Teflon Don if he was covered in Teflon\nOr a walrus who dipped all of his blubber in Exxon\nFuck a bug, he's killed any mammal he's stepped on\nIf Biggie saw this piggy, he would think he was \"Dead Wrong\"\nI mean, as far as food, what we got today? Lobster face? Pasta plate?\nHe's black and Islamic; what the fuck is he, a chocolate shake/sheikh?\nI mean, you're too fat to walk over subway grates\nBut you're in the hall of fame with Jared as the Subway Greats\nI mean, fucking, your blood pressure is higher than the price of a brick\nYou are addicted to steaks if we're talking life on the strip\nWe would need a whole tray to put ice on your wrist\nAnd your fingers are too fat, so you fucking type with a stick\nBut fuck jokes, I'll use reality to show that they're lame\n(REAL NIGGA SHIT!)\nThe joke would be you probably need two seats whenever you sit on an airplane\nThe reality would be if you sat next to on me an airplane, it wouldn't ruin my night\nIt wouldn't ruin my flight, it would ruin my life!\nHim coming down the aisle with hard steps and short breath\n\"Please, God, do not let him sit here\"—I'd be praying with palms clenched\nSit down and you're drenched from your breast to your forehead\nFuck two seats, lard fest could only fit on a park bench\nIn case of emergency landing, he'd need an extra large vest\nIf he has the window seat, the sun's eclipsed by your chest\nAnd I'd be hard-pressed to stay Meta like Artest\nBecause this guy can't keep his side fat off of the armrest\nI mean...\nI mean, it's a tight, nice little package, but I promise all that's real\nYou are inconvenient to be around, how awful does that feel?\nI mean...\nI mean, his gains could be alleviated, and his pains could be abbreviated\nWith a diet and exercise, maybe trying to be creative\nIt's really basic, but the only time he's creative\nIs making tacos with ice cream as a freaking meat replacement\nHe's got a million ways to sweeten cakes, but not one way to lean his face in?\nAlways room for cheese and bacon, but let me guess, the greens were taken?\nBut people treat it like it's a disease, a sickness to be mediated\nMisleading statements from the media, they deviate it\nLike \"It's fat shame,\" and I can't take it\nI'm trying to decrease your weight and that benefits you, so you could show some appreciation\nI mean, that fact that you're fat says so much about you as a man\nNo long-term goals, no perseverance, you can't stick to a plan\nYou only care about yourself, you're stuck in your selfish ways\nAnd none of your family members care enough about you to help you change\nBut they say \"Big T's the man,\" like that'll help him magically\nOf course you're the man, dawg, you motherfucking have to be\nYou have to be cool or funny just to get an advantage\nOtherwise, you wouldn't have a single friend on this planet\nI mean, I mean, fucking...\nFat people make less money, they get promoted less\nThey're more likely to be alone or suffer an early death\nAnd I get pissed cause you have kids and your children are gonna grow\nAnd it's a tragedy 'cause being fat is all that they'll ever know\nWhen your daughter was born, you probably weighed 355 pounds\nIf you walked a mile a day since then, he'd be skinny by now\nSo I don't give a fuck if I lose today, or fucking lose the race\nBro, you can't win at life until you fucking lose the weight, bro"
