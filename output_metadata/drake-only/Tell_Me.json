What is? What is different about me? Oh\nTell me. What is? What is?\nCan't keep you off of me\n\n\n[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]\nNowadays you can't get enough of me\nLoving me, loving me, loving me more\nYou loving me, love when you loving me\nOh yeah, yeah\n\n\n[Pre-Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]\nWhat is?\nWhat is? What is? What is different about me? Oh\nTell me. What is? What is?\nCan't keep you off of me\n\n\n\n[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]\nNowadays you can't get enought of me\nLoving me, loving me, loving me more\nYou loving me, love when you loving me...\nOh yeah yeah"
