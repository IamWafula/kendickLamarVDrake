Uhm\nNah, I mean I did it like that, I ain't gon' lie, I ain't gon' lie to you\nI did it like that, but, I ain't never been affected by another nigga crib in the way that did it to inspire me\nHow cats told me that he'd been inspired (All you do is lie to me)\nAnd felt that feelin' in they gut, like \"I gotta work harder\" (Need more than a homie)\nWell I mean workin' harder just to compete, bro, for real, for real\nIt's either you fuckin' in the game or you're out the game\nNigga, I'm back in this motherfucker, let's get some money\nIt's over, nigga, you have arrived, top five, end of discussion\nMay God bless you, Inshallah, you know what I'm sayin'?\nThis your brother, Diddy, take that\nAnd thank you for the inspiration, jheeze"
