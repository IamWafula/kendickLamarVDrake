    "Дей, гиди, пушка-бойл—",
    "Let's go",
    "Well, alright",
    "Well, alright",
    "Yeah",
    "Look, uh",
    "Feelin' sorry for the runner-up",
    "I'm still awake, gettin' money when the sun is up",
    "And they keep sayin' how they need me to deliver",
    "'Cause they hate it when a rookie star doesn't put the numbers up",
    "Man, hate is so passé, catch me in a Tom Ford suit on draft day, nigga",
    "And it's just me and my money",
    "Y'all don't even get to play when y'all are leading by twenty",
    "Yeah, I infiltrated the game",
    "I was hesitant at first and feared what it would change",
    "Now I'm high off the success and faded off of the fame",
    "And still I managed to keep all of my opinions the same",
    "Man, I am so far gone, bitch, I'm outta here",
    "Hotter than standin' inside rockin' outerwear",
    "I want it all, man, I never learned how to share",
    "I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires",
    "Wow, I swear I'm killin' shit, I'm killin' shit",
    "Shout-out to the niggas I just made a couple million with",
    "Yeah, from the beginnin' to the end",
    "Know I'm into makin' history, not into makin' friends, motherfucker"
