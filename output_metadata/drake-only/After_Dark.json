    "Aha, aha, yeah, ayy (after dark)",
    "In the whip solo, no one's gotta know (after dark)",
    "Knockin' at your door, I don't gotta work anymore (after dark)",
    "You can put your phone down, you're gonna need two hands (after dark)",
    "You can't get enough, girl, you know I set it up for after dark",
    "Late night like Left Eye, I'm creepin'",
    "Assumin' the worst 'cause I haven't heard from you all weekend",
    "Your silence is drivin' me up the wall, up the wall",
    "I cannot tell if you're duckin' calls or missin' calls",
    "'Cause you've been so patient",
    "I drink on the job and smoke on the job",
    "So, I don't know how serious you take it",
    "Can't offer much more, you've heard it before",
    "That narrative for me isn't changin'",
    "I wanna make you a priority",
    "I wanna let you know there's more to me",
    "I wanna have your faith restored in me",
    "I'll be on my way (after dark)",
    "In the whip solo, no one's gotta know (no one's gotta know, after dark)",

    "Put your feet in this water, don't wanna get your hair wet",
    "We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet",
    "You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else",
    "You like, \"-\", keep it to yourself",
    "He did you wrong, he left you down bad, now you can't trust nobody",
    "You said, \"Do anything, but just don't lie to me\"",
    "I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me",
    "Umm, pulled up to the show, then we got ghost",
    "And when it's after dark anything goes (after dark)",
    "In the whip solo, no one's gotta know (no one's gotta know, after dark)",
    "Knockin' at your door, I don't gotta work anymore (I don't gotta work no more, after dark)",
