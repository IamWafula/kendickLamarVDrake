    "Day after day, seems like I push against the clouds",
    "They just keep blocking out the sun",
    "It seems since I was born",
    "I've wakened every blessed morning",
    "Down on my luck and up against the wind",
    "Gotta hold my head high with two dry eyes",
    "I told you everything is fine, dawg, but I lied",
    "I be tryna draw the line, but it's a fine line",
    "And I'm drownin' out the noise from the sideline",
    "But it's louder than the voice I got in my mind",
    "I can't even hear myself when I get quiet time",
    "How they tellin' me I'm done, when I'm in my prime?",
    "They've been tryna push a narrative since '09",
    "And they even had my ass convinced a couple times",
    "But that ain't even the half, I had tougher times",
    "Only look for sympathy inside my mother's eyes",
    "And it's still, \"Fuck them niggas on the other side\"",
    "We got problems we could never really put aside",
    "I cracked the door for us all, put my foot inside",
    "I tried to kill them boys with kindness, but they wouldn't die",
    "So now I kill 'em all for acting like they couldn't die",
    "And I do it all for this little hood of mine",
    "And now I'm top opp to these niggas, what a time",
    "Raise 'em like a son, and still they said he couldn't shine",
    "Fuck it, I'm the one, I ain't worried 'bout the other nine",
    "Checking on my brothers help, making sure my brother fine",
    "Making sure my mother's fine",
    "Pass it to my son next, make him throw another dime",
    "Tryna find the right one, give her ass some butterflies",
    "Eleven years deep now, getting hard to summarize",
    "Niggas tryna diss me, gotta tell a bunch of lies",
    "Shit don't even cut deep, cutting like some butter knives",
    "Man, I got a hundred lives",
    "Pushing through the pain, that's why I look like I ain't troubled by",
    "More I start piecing shit together, more I'm puzzled by",
    "Fame'll have you feelin' like you're really living double lives",
    "But I know myself, and that ain't the shit they publicize",
    "Day after day, seems like I push against the clouds",
    "They just keep blocking out the sun",
    "It seems since I was born",
    "I've wakened every blessed morning",
    "Down on my luck and up against the wind",
    "Day after day, seems like I push against the clouds",
    "They just keep blocking out the sun",
    "It seems since I was born",
    "I've wakened every blessed morning",
    "Down on my luck and up against the wind",
    "Don't you stop, don't you run, don't you cry"
