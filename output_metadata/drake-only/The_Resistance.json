    "Yesterday when we were getting high",
    "You were invited, you would've liked it",
    "Uh-uh I know you all too well",
    "I said that we could kiss the past goodbye",
    "But you weren't excited, there's no way to fight it",
    "You could stay, but shawty here I go",
    "Uh, should I spend the weekend in Vegas?",
    "I'm living inside the moment, not taking pictures to save it",
    "I mean, how could I forget? My memory's never faded",
    "I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it",
    "I am, still here with who I started with",
    "The game needed life, I put my heart in it",
    "I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit",
    "Carry the weight for my city, like a cargo ship",
    "Uh, I'm 23 with a money tree",
    "Growing more too, I just planted a hunna seeds",
    "It's ironic 'cause my mother was a florist",
    "And that's how she met my pops",
    "And now my garden is enormous",
    "It's happenin' Penny Lane, just like you said",
    "I avoided the Coke game and went with Sprite instead",
    "Uh-uh, that's word to the millions that they puttin' up",
    "I'm tryna do better than good enough",
    "What am I afraid of?",
    "This is supposed to be what dreams are made of",
    "But people I don't have the time to hang with",
    "Always look at me and say the same shit",
    "They say, \"You promised me you would never change\"",
    "You promised me you would never change",
    "Am I wrong for making light of my situation?",
    "Clap on, before they got some shit for me to snap on",
    "Now that I'm on, I don't really wanna worry 'bout gettin' back on",
    "I'm just tryna stay on, get my fucking buffet on",
    "I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home",
    "And I be actin' like I don't know how to work a phone",
    "But hit re-dial, you'll see that I just called",
    "Some chick I met at the mall, that I barely know at all",
    "And, plus this woman that I messed with unprotected",
    "Texted saying she wished she would have kept it",
    "The one that I'm layin' next to just looked over and read it",
    "Man, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is",
    "I'm holding on by a thread",
    "It's like I'm high right now, the guy right now",
    "And you can tell by looking in my eyes right now",
    "That nothing really comes as a surprise right now",
    "'Cause we just having the time of our lives right now",
    "What am I afraid of?",
    "This is supposed to be what dreams are made of",
    "But people I don't have the time to hang with",
    "Always look at me and say the same shit",
    "They say, \"You promised me you would never change\"",
    "You promised me you would never change",
    "Uh, I live by some advice this girl Alyssa told me",
    "The other day Alyssa told me that she missed the old me",
    "Which made me question when I went missing",
    "And when I start treating my friends different",
    "Maybe it was the fast-paced switch up",
    "Put up two guns in my face during the stick up",
    "Maybe 'cause the girl I thought trusted",
    "Was who set the whole shit up",
    "But in fact I haven't seen 'em, since they locked Big Rich up",
    "I know, the same time I'm quick to forget",
    "I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets",
    "Burn it all, burn it all, I'm startin' it fresh",
    "'Cause half the time I got it right, I probably guessed",
    "Did I just trade free time for camera time?",
    "Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?",
    "Yeah, I just need some closure",
    "Ain't no turning back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over"
