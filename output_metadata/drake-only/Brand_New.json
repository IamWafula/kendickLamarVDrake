    "This here is on some truthful shit",
    "It seems like everything I do, you're used to it",
    "And I hate hearing stories 'bout who you've been with",
    "So then I gotta hide, what I'm feeling inside",
    "So you still think I'm confident and damn",
    "Is this gonna last? You're up on a pedastal",
    "Are we moving too fast?",
    "Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past",
    "It's why I gotta ask, ask",
    "Is anything I'm doing brand new?",
    "(Brand new), Brand new (Brand new), Brand new (Brand new)",
    "Is anything I'm doing brand new?",
    "(Brand new), Brand new (Brand new), Brand new, brand new",
    "This here is something personal",
    "I highly doubt this feeling is reversible",
    "Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know",
    "That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside",
    "So I don't ever question you and damn",
    "I can't even find, the perfect brush",
    "So I can paint what's going through my mind",
    "Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind",
    "It's why I gotta ask",
    "Is anything I'm doing brand new?",
    "(Brand new), Brand new (Brand new), Brand new (Brand new)",
    "Is anything I'm doing brand new?",
    "(Brand new), Brand new (Brand new), Brand new, brand new",
    "Is anything I'm doing brand new, new, new, new, new, new",
    "Or is everything I'm doing too late, late, late, late",
    "Did he take off your clothes off just like this",
    "Did he give you loving just like this",
    "Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date",
    "Tell me baby am I too late?",
    "Is anything I'm doing brand new?",
    "(Brand new), Brand new (Brand new), Brand new (Brand new)",
    "Show me if this is brand new?",
    "Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new",
    "Yeah, yeah yeah"
