It incorporates the same Migos verses as well but also features new verses from Meek Mill, Tyga, and KidCali.\n[Verse 1: Drake]\nVersace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati\nThis is a gated community, please get the fuck off the property\nRap must be changing cause I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me\nNiggas be wanting a verse for a verse, but man that's not a swap to me\nDrowning in compliments, pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis\nI think I'm sellin' a million first week, man I guess I'm an optimist\nBorn in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us\nWhat the fuck is you talkin' 'bout? Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars\nBoy, Versace, Versace, we stay at the mansion when we in Miami\nThe pillows' Versace, the sheets are Versace, I just won a Grammy\nI've been so quiet, I got the world like \"What the fuck is he planning?\"\nJust make sure that you got a back up plan cause that shit might come in handy\nStarted a label, the album is comin' September, just wait on it\nThis year I'm eating your food and my table got so many plates on it\nHundred inch TV at my house, I sit back like \"damn I look great on it\"\nI do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga, don't ask for my take on it\nSpeakin' in lingo, man this for my nigga that trap out the bando\nThis for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano\nFuck all your feelin's cause business is business, it's strictly financial\nI'm always the first one to get it, man that's how you lead by example\nVersace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace\nWord to New York cause the Dyckman and Heights girls are callin' me \"Papi\"\nI'm all on the low, take a famous girl out with me, no paparazzi\nI'm trying give Halle Berry a baby and no one can stop me\n[Hook: Quavo]\nVersace, Versace, Versace, Versace\nVersace, Versace, Versace, Versace\nVersace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace\nVersace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace\n\n\n[Verse 2: KidCali]\nVersace,Versace Medusa Head On Like Im 'Luminati\nIm gettin all of these fans now gettin props now im movin to fast\nUp to the top ,these girls that admire me and\nFelons who followed me\nBout to kill in this bitch\nAll of my money is short like a nominee but, you bet I get\n1000's ,nigga yeah fuckin stylin and im Countin my money better know I got profit and\nI makin yo outfits\nCall it \"Cali\" who's on it\nBout to make my Hood know it\nIm Cali Bitch Know it\nVersace drake's on it, Migos Amigos im Promo\nGod Knows it Versace, Versace, Im in it im stallion my Counrty You niggas ain't nothing im reppin my county like Ace Hood's Boward County that shit you don't know and weed you don't blow Haa ima rich as fella nigga Im on top better know im that Killer blaah make these hoes my strippers Rich Gang money better know I im young money (racks) cuz we the best what we do, all of my niggas are cocky than you now doin that shit I said I would do cheecks what you doin my nigga,vibe way to vibin don't you kill it nigga\nLike stuzzy & drew all in my flight bout to get in it too Versace, I wear it do that \"Cali\" Ware it like young money brought it all in my chains is medusa on me rappin this bitch like its julissa on this (what,is it that free jail card)\n\n\n[Verse 3: Meek Mill]\nIts killers, real niggas that's all in my posse (shooters!)\nI'm getting so rich that they making up rumors that I'm illuminati (rich!)\nJust me and my niggas we killin' these bitches, go body for body (murders!)\nThese suckers be hating, they praying to God that I don't cop a Bugatti\nHold up, drop the top on the rari\nPull in the club and I'm stopping the party\nHold up, got bitches on bitches\nThey poppin' on molly's I'm prolly at Follies with PeeWee and Tip\nQuesting with Lou\nI did everything that I said I would do\nI really won't tell you that I'm better than you\nBut we're not on the same level as you\nCause the G55 got a hell of a view\nRegular niggas make regular moves\nWith ya regular bitch and ya regular crew\nAnd you nigga still smokin on regular too?
