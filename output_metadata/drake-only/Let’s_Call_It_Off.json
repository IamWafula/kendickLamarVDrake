    "When you decided to knock on my door",
    "Did you remember what happened before?",
    "It just didn't sparkle, it just didn't grow",
    "Some things look better inside of the store",
    "Did you agree we should let it be?",
    "And did you agree, it's a must?",
    "Let's call the whole thing off, we just have had enough of us",
    "Let's call the whole thing off, we just have had enough of us",
    "I know many people who met the same way",
    "Relations that lasted for more than one day",
    "But I don't wanna know why we couldn't do more",
    "Somethings are better to leave unexplored",
    "Did you agree we should let it be?",
    "And did you agree, it's a must?",
    "Let's call the whole thing off, we just have had enough of us",
    "Let's call the whole thing off, we just have had enough of us",
    "Let's call the whole thing off, we just have had enough of us",
    "Let's call the whole thing off, we just have had enough of us"
