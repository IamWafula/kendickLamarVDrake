    "Feel like Tune",
    "I'm iller than the illness that these people wish me",
    "Drake be joshin' around, but life wasn't Nickelodeon or Disney, is you kiddin' me?",
    "My resume is thicker than Nicki, I'm busy-busy",
    "I remember doing halftime at Jackson, Mississippi",
    "Wasn't drivin' Cadillac then, but shit still found a way to escalate quickly",
    "Wanted people to miss me, changed shit after Nipsey",
    "Took the fun away, now the fun's done",
    "Roses right now though, tell 'em to run some",
    "You don't have to see thе score to know that I won some",
    "True colors always comе out like the Sun does",
    "'Specially when you assumin' the role of that nigga",
    "I keep my circle small so the blunt gets back quicker",
    "I just woke up and tripped on a glass slipper",
    "I guess Cinderella must've called up her own Uber",
    "I've always been able to see the depths of my own future",
    "Psychic readin's, corporate meetin's, power lunches",
    "Private fundin', hundred push-ups, hundred crunches",
    "Final touches, lemon squeezes, island breezes",
    "Press releases, movin' speeches, multi-taskin'",
    "Torches passin', strong attractions, forceful actions",
    "What's really crackin'?",
    "I guess I'm maintainin', thanks for askin'",
    ", yeah",
    "And I don't even need to ask how you doin' without me",
    "Your captions are more about me than you were about me",
    "Your friends come around, I don't know what they doin' around me",
    "They still come around, yeah",
    "Uh, it's worth more when you earn it, guilty the verdict",
    "Burnin' large bills in the furnace, trash bags and detergent",
    "I touched a little bit of this paper, I'm still yearnin'",
    "Drove the work three hundred times at least, I'm still nervous",
    "Here to speak for the hopefuls, keepin' it soulful",
    "Phone face down at the bar, havin' drinks at Kimodo",
    "Hope these meetin's on roof tops never turn into jail visits",
    "It only put a smile on my face when the scale tippin'",
    "Despite the well wishes from y'all, I held distance",
    "They prayin' my success stories turn into failed missions",
    "They tyin' me to greats, every other week, I'm buyin' me a safe",
    "I learned its more satisfyin' when you wait",
    "Had to hide so many stacks in my crib, I got it booby trapped",
    "My closet look like a Off-White versus Louis match",
    "All that jealousy obvious, I got hipped to it",
    "Even your compliments startin' to sound like bitterness",
    "All the pressure I'm livin' with",
    "Every line delivered with hunger, my flow a sure thing like a death certificate",
    "Soldiers is dead, spilled blood over this bread",
    "Had my family thinkin' I'm in over my head",
    "Baggin' up breathin' chemicals, when a ki' was the pinnacle",
    "Now at my high schools giving speeches, speakin' political",
    "Got here bein' original",
    "Every day its like the new me, the business man, versus me as the criminal",
    "I'm the quiet one in the room, keepin' it minimal",
    "'Til the house big enough I can park the V in the livin' room",
    "Ah, the Butcher comin', nigga"
