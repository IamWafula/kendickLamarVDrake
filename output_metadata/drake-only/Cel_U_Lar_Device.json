Press 7\nIf you're calling to book Erykah, to flip the first burger at your company BBQ, or to DJ at your little cousins slip-and-slide party, press 8\nIf you're calling to say peace, and don't really fit into any of those descriptions\nText me, because I don't really answer voicemail\n\n[Chorus]\nYou used to call me on my cellular device at night\nYou used to call me on my cellular device at night\nAnd I know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing\nI know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing\n\n\n\n[Verse 1]\nEver since I left the city you\nGot a reputation for yourself now\nEverybody knows and I feel left out\nBoy, you got me down, and got me stressed out\nCause ever since I left the city, you\nStarted gettin' dressed and goin' out more\nGlasses of champagne out on the dance floor\nHangin' with some dudes I've never seen before\n\n[Chorus]\nYou used to call me on my cellular device at night\nYou used to call me on my cellular device at night\nAnd I know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing\nI know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing\n\n\n[Verse 2]\nThem people just said let it go\nAnd on and on and such and such\nBut they don't ride around with us\nOh, no, no\nAin't that too bad we love to hang\nAnd for a while, it stays the same\nBut now you tryna change the game\nOh, no, no\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\nYou used to call me on my cellular device at night\nYou used to call me on my cellular device at night\nAnd I know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing\nI know when that hotline bling, that could only mean one thing"
