Hill)\n(Said I was in that UK, get closer to feelin' it)\nHad to double back up my double-cup, yeah, yeah\nYou gotta put up out the city, she can't get any closer\nEspecially when you're driving a bandwagon after\nYou gotta put 'em on, she like that\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nAyy, I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you\nMansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you\nKaty, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Woo)\n'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)\n'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)\n'Cause you got desires\n\n[Verse 1: Future]\nYou got that fire and I'm not a liar\nYou had me down on my knees everyday, had to talk to Messiah\nI'm in that '81 and this that '82, this a different Ferrari, yeah\nI tried to pay all of your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah\nI had you stayin' too close to the city\nYou actin' too vulnerable livin' this life\nI shoulda moved you away from Houston, before I copped you all this ice\nYou wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing\nI let you play my number two, you barely made the section\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nI should have put you somewhere where no one could find you (Find you)\nMansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you\nKaty, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)\n'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)\n'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)\n'Cause you got desires\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nI should have put you somewhere where no one could find you\nMansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you\nKaty, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Hey)\n'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)\n'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)\n'Cause you got desires\n\n[Verse 2: Future]\nYou should have did what you said you would'd do\nYou should be movin' in silence\nSee the type girl you hang with, the wildest\nNeed a better environment\nI bought bags to fill up your closet\nI pop tags, I know where I'm rounded\nI do the dashes, get higher than the mountain\nYou need class to be with a celebrity\nSo sad, you lookin' like charity\nWhat you wanna do? See niggas bury me?\nAll of my brothers are black, carry me\nI can't answer you through the legacy\nAt the embassy speak, it was like therapy\nBought a Patek Philippe in your currency\nBitches can't keep it real with a nigga movin' so desperately\nYou the one that did the Twitter shit first to see how these hoes react\nThe only one that can make me feel some way 'cause I love you back\nYou wanna be my queen, niggas fuckin' on you, think I'ma take you back?\nYour bags are secured at home, relax\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nI should have put you somewhere where no one could find you\nMansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you\nKaty, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Hey)\n'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)\n'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)\n'Cause you got desires\n\n[Outro: Future & Drake]\nI should have put you somewhere where no one could find you\nMansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you\nCalifornia, Santa Barbara, you know, an early retirement (Oh)\n'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know"
