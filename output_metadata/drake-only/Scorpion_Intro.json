    "(My bed, my bed, my bed)",
    "(Somebody's sleeping in my bed, baby)",
    "Yeah (Somebody's sleeping in my bed)",
    "I'm in New York and you're in Long Island",
    "I don't even treat you that good, girl, why you smilin'?",
    "It's three in the mornin', why you drivin'?",
    "Why you stoppin' for gas to get on the highway, just to end up in my place?"
