Posted on October’s Very Own.\nJ.Cole wrote a beautiful and moving apology to individuals and families affected by autism who were understandably hurt by a verse in \"Jodeci Freestyle\"\n. I share responsibility and offer my sincerest apologies for the pain this has caused. Individuals with autism have brilliant and creative minds, and their gifts should not be disparaged or discounted.\n This was a learning lesson for both of us,\n and I’m grateful for the opportunity to try to right this wrong.\n J. Cole and I believe that it is the right, responsible, and respectful decision to remove the lyric from the song."
