    "Got a couple nicknames",
    "...know your bones aching",
    "Sometimes you light headed...",
    "Like a bluesman",
    "...the offer you give me was preposterous",
    "Papi, this bird won't fly, you sold me an ostrich",
    "I'm just another nigga tryna keep his money up",
    "I'll wipe that smirk off your face, you think it's funny, huh?",
    "I ain't playin' my nigga, go ahead and giggle",
    "But bullets don't tickle",
    "If you think you playin' with Elmo, hell no"
