(Interlude)” to create a gloomy short film.\n-- TIMELINE --\n*** PART 1: U ***\n\n[Credits - 'U']\n\n(1) Transitional Slide - 'U'\n\n\nScene 1: Screams\n(00:00 - 00:30)\nWith the opening screams the audience can also sense that something is eerie; these sounds are in the original track combined creating a dangerous visual. Then beginning to see Kendrick pouring his heart out in to his liquor in a schizophrenic manner.\n\n\n\n\nScene 2: The Hotel Room\n(00:30 - 01:26)\nHearing the chorus \"Loving you is complicated\" - the image starts to depict that there is an internal struggle going on with him loving himself. The scene is immensely minimalistic and filled with dark lighting, this accompanied by his throne like chair creates for a deep setting for imagery to take a place in the film.\n\n\n\n\nScene 3: Mirror\n(01:27 - 01:57)\nThe mirror representative of an internal reflection; as the struggle of how he views himself as the words utter \"I ****** tell you, you ****** failure—you ain't no leader!\", the negatively intrinsic views we beginnings to see why he hates himself for the mistakes he has made.\n\n\n\n\nScene 4: Tipsy\n(01:57 - 02:10)\nStumbling all over the place into his throne - blurred visions of the camera shaking around giving us P.O.V. (Point of Vision) of what it is like to be overly intoxicated.\n\n\n\n\nScene 5: Room Service\nThe skit from 'u' begins to play before we hear the drunk Lamar entering in the next scene.\n\nDialogue\nEffect on the Audience\n\n(2) Transitional Slide - '8'\n\n\nScene 6 Part 1: Spinning Bottle\n(02:37 - 03:42)\nA very unique and a extremely interesting shot with a spinning bottle in the back ground seemingly to play spin the bottle by himself.\nNotice this high angle shot focusing down on Lamar with a demonic reflection in the background of the mirror choosing to do it's own thing every now and then.\n\n\n\n\n\nScene 6 Part 2: Smashed Mirror\n(03:30 - 03:42)\nAn easily missed technique of a reflection of himself breaking the mirror of reality down, smashing into pieces before the screen goes black into the next slide.\n\n\n\n\n\n(3) Transitional Slide - 'Clearance sale: 100% off'\n*** PART 2: For Sale ***\n\n[Credits - 'For Sale']\n\n\nScene 1: The Dunk\n(03:43 - 07:11)\nA symbolistic baptism that takes Kendrick under thats meant to cleanse him from his impurities and sins of the night to be reborn again. This scene is a complete contrast from Scene 2 which compliments to criticism of the hip hop industry in \"For Sale\".\n\n\n(4) Transitional Slide - 'Life is like a box of chickens'\n\n\n(5) Transitional Slide - 'Instagram 2016: Dussy unlimited'\n\n\n(6) Transitional Slide - 'If I blame you for a loss, I’ll be giving you all the credit'\n\n\n\n(7) Transitional Slide - 'Good dussy can make you melt'\n\n\nScene 2: Lust\n(04:03)\n'Lucy's' temptations are all around Kendrick whether it's smoking weed, making him famous or filling his pockets with money these comparisons are depicted through the naked women in scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n(8) Transitional Slide - 'Always trust a n**** with cornrows'\n\nScene 3: Lost/Distractions\n(04:10)\nIt seems like Kendrick is trying to keep focus and maintain what is important to him, looking unaware and lost he is staring into the same place not noticing the women and putting aside these distractions.\n\n(9) Transitional Slide - 'Time is change, your friend or foe'\n\n(10) Transitional Slide - 'Never trust a n**** with too many haircuts'\n\n(11) Transitional Slide - 'Tracee Ellis Ross is vibrant'\n\nScene 4: Demonic Eyes\n(04:24 - 04:38)\nSeducing Kendrick into these sinful acts seeming to illustrate a lucifer idea or connection - depicted through the lighting, eyes and the heads tilt provides an uncomfortable mood for the audience.\n\nScene 5: Upside Down\n(04:39)\n*Conscious speaking*\n\n(12) Transitional Slide - 'I made money, I lost money, I did it again'\n(13) Transitional Slide - 'Dussy salary cap'\n\n(14) Transitional Slide - 'Water dawg'\n\n\n(15) Transitional Slide - 'I followed your rules for way too long'\n\n(16) Transitional Slide - 'Night like this I wish that bomb head would fall'\n\nScene 6: Bridge\n(05:59 - 06:09)\nThis scene makes little sense in the film and stands out like a sore thumb and really questions the audience about what is happening.\n\n\n\n\n\nScene 7: Trapped\n(00:00 - 00:00)\nHow the industry strips you down for what you have got like strippers and take your money and keep you trapped in their vicious cycle.\n\n(17) Transitional Slide - 'My tastebloods is expensive'\n\nScene 8: Waking up\n(00:00 - 00:00)\n*Waking up out of it? To reality since it can be so consuming like the big screen*\n\n(18) Transitional Slide - 'You played the game, I pimped it'\n\n(19) Transitional Slide - 'God is gangsta'\n\nScene 9: Drowning to being brought back\n(00:00 - 00:00)\nAfter the extended drowning.. longer time under sins.\n\nScene 10: Unexpected bridge cut\n(00:00 - 00:00\n)\n\n(20) Transitional Slide - 'Fin'\n\nCONCLUSION"
