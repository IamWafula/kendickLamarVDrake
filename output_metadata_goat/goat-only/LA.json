    "Take me back to LA",
    "Take me back to LA",
    "Take me back to LA, ohh",
    "I've laughed and I've cried",
    "I've lived and I've died",
    "Stole from, gambled and cheated",
    "Cut corners outside",
    "I've tried and I've failed",
    "Stood tall when they'd run",
    "I've fought a cold war",
    "In the dead of the hot sun",
    "Now take me back to LA",
    "Where the weather is good",
    "Take me back to LA",
    "Don't wanna give the road a second look",
    "And I remember first time that I left",
    "Pain, it flooded the wells of your eyes",
    "You said you'd never forgive me if I didn't make it back",
    "But now I'm comin' home for some good lovin'",
    "I've learned and I've taught",
    "I've gained and I've lost",
    "Made due with what I'm made of",
    "Found out what love cost",
    "Learned who I can't trust",
    "Learned that it's just us",
    "I've learned to love mine",
    "Even when it ain't much",
    "Now take me back to LA",
    "Where the weather is good",
    "Take me back to LA",
    "Don't wanna give the road a second look",
    "And I remember first time that I left",
    "Pain, it flooded the wells of your eyes",
    "You said you'd never forgive me if I didn't make it back",
    "But now I'm comin' home for some good lovin'",
    "Take me back to LA",
    "Take me back to LA",
    "Take me back to LA, ooh"
