    "I'm always ready for a war again",
    "Go down that road again, it's all the same",
    "And I'm always ready to take a life again",
    "You know I'll ride again, it's all the same",
    "Tell me who's gonna save me from myself",
    "When this life is all I know",
    "Tell me who's gonna save me from this hell",
    "Without you, I'm all alone",
    "Who's gonna pray for me? And take my pain for me?",
    "And save my soul for me? 'Cause I'm alone, you see",
    "If I'm gonna die for you, if I'm gonna kill for you",
    "Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey",
    "I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself",
    "I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left",
    "I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept",
    "I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps",
    "Life a living hell, puddles of blood in the streets",
    "Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief",
    "Earthquake, the body drop, the ground breaks",
    "The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface",
    "Who need a hero?",
    "You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero",
    "Who on the front lines at ground zero?",
    "My heart don't skip a beat even when hard times bumps the needle",
    "Mass destruction and mass corruption, the souls are suffering men",
    "Clutching on deaf ears again, rapture is coming",
    "It's all prophecy, and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good",
    "Then that's what it gotta be",
    "Who's gonna pray for me? And take my pain for me?",
    "And save my soul for me? 'Cause I'm alone, you see",
    "If I'm gonna die for you, if I'm gonna kill for you",
    "Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey",
    "Who's gonna pray for me? And take my pain for me?",
    "And save my soul for me? 'Cause I'm alone, you see",
    "If I'm gonna die for you, if I'm gonna kill for you",
    "Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey",
    "Just in case my faith goes, I'll live by my own",
    "I'll live by my own, I'll live by my own"
