And I'm proud of us in this moment, how fitting that it’s on Juneteenth! This is a victory lap, y'all know what I wore. But man, as history has shown, it's always been a fire and a certain kind of spark coming up out of Compton, especially. Y’all always rise up from the ashes and rise to the occasion. You love when they count you out\n\n[Part I]\n\n[Verse]\nThem super powers gettin' neutralized, I can only watch in silence\nThe voice artist we once knew is lookin' paranoid and now is spiralin'\nYou're movin' just likе a degeneratе, every antic is feelin' distasteful\nI calculate you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angle\nFabricatin’ stories on the family front, ’cause you heard Mr. Morale\nA pathetic master manipulator, I can smell them lies on you now\nYou're not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accepted\nTommy Hilfiger stood out, but FUBU never had been your collection\nI make music that electrify ’em, you make music that pacify 'em\nI can double down on that line, but spare you this time\nRandom acts of kindness\nKnow you a master manipulator and habitual liar too\nBut don't tell no lie about me, and I won't tell truths ’bout you\n\n[Part II]\n\n[Intro]\n(Shoo, shoo, shoo)\n(Shoo, shoo, shoo)\nBee, bee, bee, bee, bee, bee\n\n\n\n[Verse 1]\nYeah, I'm out the way, yeah, I'm low, okay\nYeah, the island right here's remote, okay\nThinkin' about no reaper, nigga, I'm reapin' what I sow, okay\nBenjamin and a Jackson's all in my house like I'm Joe, okay\nHellcat, made his homeboys and them type sell they soul, okay\nEverybody wanna be demon 'til they get chipped by a throwaway\nAnd I might do a show a day, once a lame, always a lame\nOh, you thought the money, the power, the fame would make you go away?\nHave you ever played have-you-ever? Okay, nigga, let's play\nHave you ever walked your enemy down like with a poker face?\nHave you ever paid five hundred thou' like to an open case?\nWell, I have, and I failed at both, but I came out straight\nI hate when a rapper talk about guns, then somebody die, they turn into nuns\nHop online, \"Pray for my city\"\nHe fakin' for likes and digital hugs\nDaddy a killer, he wanna be junior, must've forgot the shit that they done\nDementia must run in his family, get shaky\nI'll park his son\nThe very first time I shot me a Drac', the homie had told me to aim it this way\nI didn't point down enough\nToday, I'll show you I learned from those mistakes\nSomebody had said that you got a ring, God, I'm ready to double the wage\nI'd rather do that than let a Canadian nigga make 'Pac turn in his grave\nCutthroat business, you got shit twisted\nWhat is it? The braids?\nI hurt your feelings? You don't wanna work with me no more? Okay\nIt's three GOATs left, and I seen two of them kissin' and huggin' on stage\nI love 'em to death, and in eight bars, I'll explain that phrase, huh\nIt's nothin' nobody can tell me\nI don't wanna talk on no celly\nYou know I got language barriers\nIt's no accent you can sell me\nYeah, Cole and Aubrey know I'm a selfish nigga, the crown is heavy\nI pray they my real friends, if not, I'm YNW Melly\nI don't like you poppin' shit at Pharrell, for him, I inherit the beef\nAyy, fuck all that pushin' P, let me see you push a T\nYou better off spinnin' again on him, you think about pushin' me\nHe's Terrence Thornton, I'm Terence Crawford, yeah, I'm whoopin' feet\nWe ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade\nYou should keep it that way\nKnow some shit about niggas, make Gunna Wunna look like a saint\nAin't been about critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest\nAlways been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest\nI hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that—\nYou thought, you want that feature request, you know that we got some shit\nI even hate when you say the word \"nigga,\" but that's just me, I guess\nSome shit just cringeworthy, it ain't even gotta get—\nStill love when you see success, everything with me is blessed\nKeep makin' me dance, wavin' my hand, and there won't be no threat\nI'm knowin' they call you The Boy, where is the man? I ain't seen him yet\nGive me Tupac ring back, and I might give you a little respect\n\nRemember? Ayy, Top Dawg\nCrush my middle name, and still, they walk around with that—\nI don't like when you— only you like bein'\nYachty can't give you no swag neither, I don't give a— hold up\n\n\n\n[Verse 2]\nAyy, Top Dawg, who the fuck they think they playin' with?\nCrush my middle name, and you walked outta that plane, bitch\nI'm allergic to the lame shit, only you like bein' famous\nYachty can't give you no swag neither\nI don't give a fuck 'bout who you hang with\nI hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress\nSurprised you wanted that feature request, you know that we got some shit to address\nI even hate when you say the word \"nigga,\" that's just me, I guess\nSome shit just cringeworthy, it ain't even gotta be—\nStill love when you see success, everything with me is blessed\nKeep makin' me dance, wavin' my hand, it won't be no threat\nI'm knowin' they call you The Boy, but where is a man? I ain't seen him yet\nMatter fact, I ain't even bleed him yet, can I bleed him? (Bet)\nWhen I see you stand by Sexyy Red, I believe you see two bad bitches\nI believe you don't like women, real competition, you might pop ass with 'em\nLet's speak on percentage, show me your splits, I'll make sure I double back with ya\nYou were signed to a nigga that's signed to a nigga that was said he was signed to that nigga\nTry cease and desist on the \"Like That\" record?\nOh, what? You ain't—\n\"Back To Back,\" I—\nI'ma get back to that, for the record\nWhy would I turn around, tryna run on niggas?\nY'all thinkin' my life is—\nThat's ho shit, I got a son to raise, but I can see you don't know nothin' 'bout that\nWakin' him up (Know nothin' 'bout that)\nThen makin' him pray (Know nothin' 'bout that)\nThen givin' him truth to walk through life like day by day (Know nothin' 'bout that)\nTeachin' him code, and honor, and discipline, listen, man (You don't know nothin' 'bout that)\nGivin' him truth, tell him what God's considerin' (You don't know nothin' 'bout that)\nAin't twenty-v-one, it's one-v-twenty if I gotta smack niggas that write with you\nYeah, bring 'em out too, I'll clean 'em out too, tell BEAM that he better stay right with you\nAm I battlin' ghost or AI?\nNigga feelin' like Joel Osteen\nFunny, he was in a film called A.I\nAnd my sixth sense tellin' me to off him\nI'ma blick niggas all in they coffin\nYeah, OV-ho niggas is dick rider\nThey run to America to imitate heritage\nThey can't imitate this violence\nWhat I learned, these niggas don't like the West Coast\nAnd I'm fine with it, I'll push the line with it\nPick a nigga off one at a time with it\nWe can be on a two-hour time difference\n\nDon't speak on the family\nIt can get deep in your family, crodie\nTalk about me and my family, crodie?\nSomeone gon' bleed in your family, crodie\nI be at New Ho King eatin' fried rice with a dip sauce and a blammy\nTell me you're cheesin', fam\nWe can do this right now on the camera\nAyy, fuck y'all niggas, I don't trust y'all niggas\nI wave one finger and thump y'all niggas like\nField goal, punt y'all niggas, they punk y'all niggas, nobody never took my food\nWhoever that's fuckin' with him\nAnd fuck the industry too\nIf you take it there, I'm takin' it further\nThat's something you don't wanna do\n\n\n\n[Outro]\nWe don't wanna hear you say \"nigga\" no more\nWe don't wanna hear you say \"nigga\" no more"
