    "I'm a Comptown nigga, kill the casket",
    "Go against me? That'll lead to my advantage",
    "Because I've got to eat, and for real, I'm feeling kind of famished",
    "Hotter than the Earth core, don't show me where no fan is",

    "You're not up to par, and I don't play with mini-golf and sharks",
    "Jump inside the pool of sharks,",
    " we're biting off your head",
    "Your heart, your legs, arms, bled, like Jay Rock or Big Wy",
    "And make sure you wear a vest, because they my family ties",
    "Suit up, you got a three piece?",
    " I got a three piece",
    "A MAC-11, a 9 mili, and a DE, he backpedaling like a DB",
    "I'm such a Martian, call me ET",

    "No, I'm serious, skip the birth canal and climb straight Cesarean",
    "You niggas ain't listening",
    "I'm not from 'round these parts, I'm non-existent",
    "Hit you with brake light, leave you missing"
