    "Sometimes, I wish I was somebody",
    "Anybody but myself",
    "Oh I wish I was somebody",
    "Anybody but myself",
    "If I told you I'm about to break, would you look at me different?",

    "It's apparent that transparency never see monotony",
    "Got off a tour looking for closure, mixing emotions of being grateful and feeling like some of y'all getting over",
    "What's a puppet on stage, singing and dancing ablaze but trading his worth?",
    "Distorted by the moneys thats made slave with a verse",

    "And I admit I can be dismissive, if I can't relate",
    "And I admit that my only commit to stop playing games",
    "And I admit that I'm bad at talking myself out of shame",
    "And who's to blame when the crowd stops cheering and they passing dirty looks",
    "I know understand that I'll never be understood, blah!",

    "The pain too traumatic for relief",
    "Pull the curtain let the audience see ya",
    "I wish I was somebody",
    "Anybody but myself",
    "Oh I wish I was somebody",
    "Anybody but myself"
