Bitch, you power trippin' or guilt trippin'?\nI held your ass down, stupid-ass\nYou just kept me down, that's a big difference\nStressin' myself tryna figure why I'm not good enough\nGoin' to church, prayin' for you, searchin' for good in us\nLil' dick-ass nigga that's tryna go big\nBut you was suckin' this dick though\nWell, shit, I shoulda sucked his\nWhat you say?\nI shoulda found a bigger dick\nBitch, get the fuck out my face, bro\nOh, what, you mad?\nShut up, bitch, you got me fucked up today, on God\nHaha, ah-ha, you mad, lil' feelings is shot\nGo text that raggedy bitch and tell her you all that she got\nLet her know you packin' yo' shit and gotta move by the first\nMan, give me these fuckin' keys\nGive me my keys, I'ma be late for work\nFuck yo' job, today gon' be the day you walk to that bitch, bitch\nGive me my fuckin' keys\nNope, I like you parked in that bitch, ho\nGive me my keys, bro\nOn God, you ain't gettin' these keys\nGive me my fucking keys\nAh, now you mad at me, I got you hollerin' for nothin'\nI do the same when we fuckin'\nAct like that pussy ain't loose\nI'd rather act like I'm cummin'\nI'd rather fuck off the juice\nI'd rather fuck on your cousin\nBitch, you said you gon' fuck who?\nYou heard me, nigga, it's nothin'\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Taylour Paige]\nYou know what? Fuck you, bitch (Fuck you, nigga)\nStupid-ass, fuck you, bitch (Fuck you nigga)\nFeasty-ass, dirty bitch (Nah, fuck you, nigga)\nMan, fuck you, bitch (Fuck you, fuck you)\nFuck you, fuck you (Fuck you, loser-ass), fuck you, fuck you, bitch (Fuck you), weirdo-ass\nOoh, I fuckin'—\n\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Taylour Paige]\nI don't even know why I fuck with you\nAh, I'll be damned if I'm stuck with you\nChanged my number, I'm duckin' you, bitch\nBitch, whatever is comfortable\nThis the type of shit couples do?\nShoulda thought about cuffin' you\nNigga, you dirty and you broke\nHo, you goofy and gullible, goofy-ass\nThem insecurities you got won't mindfuck me\nWomanizer, got no affection from yo' mama, I see\nDon't speak on my mama, the fuck is yo' problem?\nThat bitch don't like me anyways\nBitch, she gave you the Honda\nAnd used that shit to throw it in my face\nI find it funny you just can't apologize\nEgotistic, narcissistic, love, you're all lies\nSee, you the reason why strong women fucked up\nWhy they say it's a man's world, see, you the reason for Trump\nYou the reason we overlooked, underpaid, under-booked, under shame\nIf you look, I'on't speak, then I'm called on my name\nI am flawed, I am pained, never yours, I remain\nYou the reason bitches start fuckin' with bitches when they change\nYou the reason bitches start callin' y'all bitches, 'cause y'all useless\nYou the reason Harvey Weinstein had to see his conclusion\nYou the reason R. Kelly can't recognize that he's abusive\nMan, you the reason why bitches like you still playin' his music (Ooh, my God, like)\n(How are you still—? How are you still fucking talking?) And I'm tired of these emotional-ass, ungrateful-ass bitches\nFake innocent, fake feminist, stop pretendin' (Fake, nigga? Fake?)\nY'all sentiment ain't realer than what you defendin' (Oh, my god)\nIt's a split decision, broads like you and real victims\nLet's talk the truth, women in general just can't get along (Explain, nigga)\nUh, when Tash got a man, you didn't pick up the phone (Explain, nigga)\nUh, when Nate found a job, you said you goin' home (Explain)\nWhy R&B bitches don't feature on each other songs then?\nWhat the fuck is you talkin' 'bout?\nNever mind, bitch, I'm walkin' out\nWhatever, nigga, I'm off you now\nYo' evil ass kept me well in doubt\nPussy nigga, best watch your mouth\nPussy and mouth is all you got\nLay this pussy back on the couch\nDoggie style, then you get on top\n\n\n\n[Outro: Taylour Paige & Kendrick Lamar]\nFuck me, nigga (I'ma fuck you, bitch)\nNah, fuck me, nigga, fuck me (I'ma fuck you, bitch)\nNah, fuck me, nigga, fuck me (Take that shit off)\nOoh, I swear to God I fuckin' hate you\nMm, ah, ah\nMhm, mm\nAh, just a break"
