    "That I can do anything, do anything, yeah",
    "When I look, when I look in the mirror",
    "I see the hero inside of me",
    "And I feel no fear, no fear, no fear",
    "I'm flying the way I'm supposed to be",
    "Looking for a feast, yes, but we can find out",

    "Now, I'm done searching for answers",
    "Thinking of medicine I need to go",
    "When it's over, will I know?",
    "Should I hold on? Should I let go?",
    "Sometimes it's better left unsaid",
    "But something inside of me is making me believe",
