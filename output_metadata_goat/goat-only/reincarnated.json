    "\"Every individual is only a version of you",
    "How can they forgive when there's no forgiveness in your heart?\"",
    "I could tell You where I'm goin', \"I could tell you who you are\"",

    "Didn't like authority, only searched to be heinous",
    "Isaiah 14 was the only thing that was prevalent",
    "My greatest music director was you",
    "It was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues",

    "And all I ever wanted from You was love and approval",
    "I learned a lot, no more puttin' these people in fear",
    "The more that word is diminished, the more it's not real",
    "The more light that I can capture, the more I can feel",
    "I'm usin' words for inspiration as an ideal",
    "\"So, can you promise that you won't take your gifts for granted?\"",
