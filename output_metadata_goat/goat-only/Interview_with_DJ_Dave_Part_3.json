But what separates our company from their company?\n\n[Kendrick Lamar]\nConsistency, man. You know, just, you know, perfect your craft, man. Try to block out all that other shit, man, just worry about your craft. Business, and the business will fall in place\n\nLike my nigga J Black say:\n\n\"Change is coming\""
