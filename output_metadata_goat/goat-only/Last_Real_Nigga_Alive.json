    "Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ",
    "He's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu",
    "Look at the life that I been through",
    "We the last real niggas alive, that's official",
    "Let me tell you when it all started",
    "Game dropped Documentary and made plenty enemies",
    "It was a classic album, but prior to that",
    "Guerilla Black debuted and put the city on wax",
    "A lot of Biggie comparisons, we all was aware of them",
    "But that wasn't my M.O., I just thought he was dope",
    "Can't understand why Game would say his name in that manner",
    "Many years went by. Still, no legitimate answer",
    "Anyway, I put out a mixtape in 12th grade",
    "Hub City threat, minor of the year, DJ Dave",
    "And his brother designed, put together the music",
    "Put it out to the people, the people said I was stupid",
    "With the flow, went to the barbershop to show off my skills",
    "Mike and Himey and some other cat said I was real",
    "Himey was Game's barber, the other cat made a statement",
    "Saying that Game was his partner, so I gave him my tape",
    "Said he'd play it for him, hoping that I'd get my big break",
    "But never got a response. Anyway",
    "This nigga named Pop Gates came to my school with a camera",
    "I freestyled on his DVD for a minute, then after",
    "It hit the streets. I was known as K. Dot from Compton",
    "Man, Hootie probably was the youngest out that was poppin'",
    "But I didn't have a home yet. Hootie had laws in me",
    "Until I met Top Dawg, told Dave that he'd like to meet",
    "Me at the studio, made me freestyle for an hour",
    "Told me come back tomorrow, but I came back in an hour",
    "Jay Rock was in the booth, recording his first mixtape",
    "Was skeptical homie at first because he knew where I stayed",
    "But we got over that. Heard the beat, wrote a rap",
    "Did our first collaboration on the Nephew track",
    "He got signed months later; Warner Brothers",
    "We started on his album, he wrote his rhymes on paper",
    "Before Sidekicks became a modern day phone",
    "Same time, our buzz was generated from G Malone",
    "He had a song called 200, White Lightnin', the streets loved it",
    "Said that Sony had given him an unbelievable budget",
    "Now that's a smart nigga. I'm tryna make my raps bigger than life",
    "But not knowing how to market it right",
    "Turned on the radio, only cat new from the West Coast was playin' was Bishop",
    "And by then, this nigga' buzz was tremendous",
    "In the lab, me and Rock tryna perfect our craft",
    "What the fuck? Next thing you know, we came across Lift Me Up",
    "It was a hit when I heard it, but all we had was the instrumental and the hook",
    "But when Rock jump on it for certain, it was to smash",
    "Gave it to Julio, just to get his opinion",
    "Next thing you know, the record was spinning",
    "That was a good look. It set the coast on fire",
    "Niggas in Garden projects presents Watts Riot",
    "Then these rappers start hating, callin' up to the station",
    "Ask why they record ain't playin'. What you niggas complaining about?",
    "Shit was funny to us though",
    "Niggas hate to see a nigga from the bottom come up, yo",
    "In the midst of the single poppin' and niggas tryna seek and destroy",
    "I had a situation with Def Jam, premature",
    "Shit went sour after Jay-Z left, but I didn't care",
    "I was glad Jay-Z gave me respect. See, I was young",
    "Fast-forward, Hot Dollah had the streets on lock",
    "Far as radio play, obvious, he got a lot",
    "Beefing with Daz Dilinger, Jay Rock spoke on it",
    "Which, in my opinion, I didn't think the shit was impo'tant",
    "But that's a whole 'nother story. We hit the lab with Game",
    "And a few other names like Juice and Young, ya boy",

    "Then everybody start to scream out the new West",
    "And claim that West Coast legends don't want to see him at best",

    "Tell 'em that Ab-soul said it. They can quote him twice",
    "Then Crooked I came with Hip-Hop Weekly, killin' the internet",

    "It finally started to look like the West was makin' moves",
    "Western Union had the whole block boomin' because of Snoop",
    "Matter fact, Bad Lucc was my favorite about the group",
    "Then Problem Took off, another Compton native",
    "We both Compton niggas, but Compton still ain't made it",
    "By this time, Jay Rock and All My Life hit the airwaves",
    "We almost got into some major beef over Lil' Wayne",
    "That part I'mma leave out",
    "There's certain things that the streets only should know about",
    ". Shout out to Nipsey",
    "Bishop wins that game, then had a fight with X.O",
    "That's when I dropped C4 and had the critics mad at me",
    "Because they didn't see my views. Grab the hottest album out and re-do it",
    "That's a goddamn power move, stupid",
