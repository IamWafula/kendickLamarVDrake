Why are you watching the sun?\n\n[Baby Keem]\nI’ve always wondered why people say we shouldn't stare at this powerful source of energy. Made me curious.\n\n[Yara Shahidi]\nWhat if you go blind?\n\n[Baby Keem]\nI've never heard of anyone goin’ blind from starin' at the Sun.\n\n[Yara Shahidi]\nGuess you got a point there. Have you seen anything yet?\n\n[Baby Keem]\nMany things.\n\n\n\n[Yara Shahidi]\nLike what?\n\n[Baby Keem]\nSee for yourself. You should turn off the phone.\n\n[Baby Keem]\nWelcome to the present.\n\n[Part II]\n\n[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]\nToo many opinions in the glasshouse\nThis world full of ego, let me cash out\n\n\n[Chorus: Baby Keem]\nJump in that—, jump in that bitch (Ho)\nJump in that— (Ho), jump in that bitch (Ho)\nJump in that— (Ho, ho), jump in that—\n(Jump in that bitch)\n(Fuck nigga)\nJump in that bitch, run in that bitch\nJump in that-jump in that bitch\n\n\n[Verse: Baby Keem & Kendrick Lamar]\n\nTwo trench coats in the bag\nBaby Keem, king of rap\nAnd I think he just came back\nHow the fuck did I go back? (pgLang)\nGet your case off my back (pgLang)\nThat my son, wait, relax (It's the language)\nBeat my son, go to your room (pgLang, pgLang)\nStop sneak-dissin', that ain't bool\nPlay both sides, huh\nShe love all my guys, huh\n\n\n\n[Part III]\n\n[Spoken Word: Eckhart Tolle & Baby Keem]\nAs we grow up, we begin to identify with things (Bitch). Which means, identify means, we divide all sense of who we are from certain things. When you're identified with something that you are not, it always leads to suffering and unhappiness.\n\n[Part IV]\n\n[Jorja Smith]\nI wonder what he's thinking about up there. Or if he's even thinkin’ at all.\n\n\n[Outro: Florence Welch]\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh (On to each other)\nOh, oh, oh, oh (On to each other)"
