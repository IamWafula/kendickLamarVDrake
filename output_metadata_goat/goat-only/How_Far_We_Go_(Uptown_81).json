Lamar was under pressure\nDon't press ya luck when I'm pressed for time\nCuz when the press get this verse, their sure to press rewind\nThe president's prayer can't save us in my cul-de-sac\nThere's codeine, crack and cognac enough violence to keep the devil smilin' while we whilin' on them corners with them ropes and rats\nNigga build a trap house, hope his homies don't run his trap\nSee the Feds and tap out that's wrestler shit\nDon't rest your case as a gangsta because you wrestled your bitch\nWe move in silence, like the potato tip when we ridin'\nAnd we ride rotten, 2 choppers found dirty sirens\nYou ain't been where I been, I know where I'm goin'\nAnd life's a bitch, I know that she hoing\nI know what I'm sewing, what I reap\nI know that I'm flowing like water from sea or water from creek\nAnd if I don't speak, I know you ain't growin\nCuz I'm a leader, respect it when you see em\nAccepted by yo new bitch, yo old bitch and yo BM\nY'all always on that BS and PS I'm takin all fades\nI'm takin off first, this G6 is on it's way\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Mara Hruby]\nNo matter how far we go\nWe forever be real, we'll never fold\nKnow my niggas stay down, we all we know\nWe gotta get it so we live it just remember what we do and won't stop"
