    "Ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have",
    "And you're gonna pay for it",
    "I don't know if I can stop myself",
    "And you're gonna pay for it",
    "Oh, you'll never learn",
    "I touch fire, little burn",
    "This ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have",
    "And you're gonna pay for it",
    "It's a heavy load while strollin' a bumpy road",
    "No jacket when I was cold, becomin' one with my soul",
    "Stand toe to toe with my foes, these wolves in sheep clothes",
    "No weapon on me shall prosper, nigga, you better watch it",
    "You playin' with fire, burnin' you slow, hold up",
    "I hear the whispers wishin', it's all cheap voodoo",
    "I keep it cool to keep from goin' cuckoo",
    "With a cal', aimin' at fake smiles and turn 'em upside down",
    "Came too far for my feet to fail me",
    "Lord, if I'm wrong, You can help me now, hold up",
    "Wait a minute, what am I'm sayin'? The devil, he busy",
    "Tryna get me every day in every way",
    "I won't let up, I won't shut up, you can't stop me",
    "You won't knock me, ten-four, now copy",
    "Live almighty, my declaration been written",
    "In hieroglyphics on top of the highest mountain, now listen",
    "Ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have",
    "And you're gonna pay for it",
    "I don't know if I can stop myself",
    "And you're gonna pay for it",
    "I tell 'em all to hail King Kendrick, resurrectin' my vengeance",
    "Been dissectin' your motormouth 'til I break down the engine",
    "This ain't no warnin' shot, this a relevant henchman",
    "See my opponent, then cease your existence",
    "Endin' our friendship, baby, I'd rather die alone",
    "Your diaphragm is dietary, what you eatin' on?",
    "Capture your audience with these words, boy",
    "The holy chapel, the tabernacle, the book of Matthew",
    "And Jesus starin' at you, take your turn, boy",
    "See, it's gon' take a whole lot of y'all to kill me",
    "See, it's gon' take a whole tribe of y'all to kill me, I never die",
    "My pedigree apparently only to idolize",
    "Ahead of me is only my future and idle time",
    "Longevity, I gotta get used to makin' you mine",
    "You tellin' me I only get used to livin' if fine",
    "You can never live in my shoes, permanently paid from God",
    "When the sun goes down, I scream loud, I'll sleep when I die",
    "But I will never die, my legacy is alive",
    "When the sun goes down, I scream loud, I'll sleep when I die",
    "But I will never die, my legacy is alive",
    "I gotta get it off my chest, push words just like weight",
    "I got to eat 'til it shows on my face",
    "Tragedy turned to triumph, I'm tryin' just to relate",
    "Jumpin' off of them towers, I'm takin' that leap of faith",
    "Playin' at high stakes",
    "Now when I speak, their pupils'll dilate, their speakers'll vibrate",
    "Know you feelin' the vibe that Vine couldn't relate",
    "This next clip is long, a son of a gun, big numbers",
    "Do the math, now cover the sum",
    "I come from the slums, we come for the funds like, \"Run it\"",
    "Under the sun where niggas livin' their life blunted",
    "Countin' them ones, but truthfully nothin' like hundreds",
    "Keep it one hundred, road block in front of me, look, I'm runnin' through it",
    "Stickin', movin', sippin' that Hennessy, this my gutter fluid",
    "Nothin' to it, what we lost, we gon' make it back",
    "Like it wasn't missin', now listen, you 'bout to pay for that",
    "Oh, you'll never learn",
    "I touch fire, little burn",
    "This ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have",
    "And you're gonna pay for it"
