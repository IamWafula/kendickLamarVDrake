I don't know Twin\nKnow twin, If she legal will he smash? No twin, No Twin, We might fuck around and go spin, If he respond ima drop another song by ten, cause niggas ain't on shit and it's evident\n\nVerse 2:\nNiggas talking bout size 7 feet, nigga my feet still bigger than the chicks that you meet, Keep talking bout Whitney like shit's sweet Well if you wanted to be whitney, It would sound like this, G. like: And I---- Will always, Love Kids\nNigga fuck you think this shit is? It's Kenny bitch, dont need no switch, ima press it till it's empty, Whats luv in the rap game when jealous ones really envy? And nigga catch me on the breakfast club i might just chop it up with envy, Massacring all my enemies, Living in their mind rent free\n\nHook:\nThis lil nigga really tryna get a look in\nBitch shut the fuck up we don't care bout no bookings\nYou won't smash no bitch unless she looks ten (both ways)\nIs Drizzy creeping on your daughter? I don't know Twin\nKnow twin, If she legal will he smash? No twin, No Twin, We might fuck around and go spin, If he respond ima drop another song by ten, cause niggas ain't on shit and it's evident\n\n\n\nVerse 3:\nGambling and drinking, Through the glass i can see his life is at stake\nOk aubrey you mike? On topic thats the icing of the cake\nRead between the lines when i prophesise the rhymes that i make\nTBC-"
