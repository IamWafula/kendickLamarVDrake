Anna Wise]\n\nI do what I wanna do\nI say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I\nLook in the mirror and know I'm there\nWith my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\n\n\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nI promise that I know you very well\nYour eyes never lie, even if they tell\nSweet lullabies that come with a smell\nOf a dozen roses flipping down the green hill\n\nYou're living in a world that come with plan B\n'Cause plan A never relay a guarantee\nAnd plan C never could say just what it was\n\nAnd your plans only can pan around love\nYou love him, you love them, you love her\nYou love so much, you love when love hurts\n\nYou love red bottom and gold that say \"Queen\"\n\nYou love hand-bag on the waist of your jean\nYou love French tip and trip that pay for\nYou love bank slip that tell you we paid more\nYou love a good hand whenever the card dealt\nBut what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]\nI do what I wanna do\nI say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I\nLook in the mirror and know I'm there\nWith my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real,\n ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)\n\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nI promise that I know you very well\nYour eyes never lie, even if they fell\nOut the sky and your optics turn stale\nWhere they mold that's green,\n I can see you fit the bill\nOf living in a world that come with plan B\n'Cause plan A only can make another mistake\nAnd you can't see success coming from plan C\nWhen it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely\nAnd love them and love when you love her\nYou love so much, you love when love hurts\n\nYou love fast cars and dead presidents old\n\nYou love fast women, you love keepin' control\nOf everything that you love, you love beef\nYou love streets, you love running, ducking police\nYou love your hood, might even love it to death\nBut what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]\nI do what I wanna do\nI say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I\nLook in the mirror and know I'm there\nWith my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real\n ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)\n\n\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]\n\nThe reason why I know you very well\n'Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell?\nThe days I tried to cover up and conceal\nMy pride, it only made it harder for me to deal\n\nWhen living in a world that come with plan B\n\nA scapegoat 'cause plan A don't come free\n\nAnd plan C just an excuse like \"because\"\nOr the word \"but,\" but what if I got love?\nI love them, I love when I love her\n\nI love so much, I love when love hurts\nI love first verse 'cause you're the girl I attract\nI love second verse 'cause you're the homie that pack\n\nBurner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch\n\nI love what the both of you have to offer\nIn fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else\n\nBut what love got to do with it when I don't love myself\n\nTo the point I should hate everything I do love\nShould I hate living my life inside the club?\nShould I hate her for watching me for that reason?\nShould I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?\nShould I hate them for telling me \"ball out\"?\nShould I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about\nHating all money, power, respect in my will\n\nOr hating the fact none of that shit make me real?\n\n\n\n[Skit: Kenny Duckworth]\nKenny, I ain't trippin' off them dominoes anymore\nJust calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy\n\nBut don't learn the hard way like I did, homie\nAny nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga\n\nReal is responsibility\nReal is taking care of your motherfucking family\nReal is God, nigga\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]\nI do what I wanna do\nI say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I\nLook in the mirror and know I'm there\nWith my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real\n ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)\n\n\n[Skit: Kenny Duckworth & Paula Duckworth]\nAlright, that's all I wanted to tell you\nJust make sure you call us back when you get this message\nHere go your mama\n\nBoy, you better have my car on full all this time you done had my damn car\nBut look, I ain't trippin'\n\nLook, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by Food for Less\n\nAnd they was preaching to you, over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what y'all need\n\nOh, and Top Dawg called the house too\nI guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio\nBut look, you take that music business serious, and put out somethin' me and your dad can step to\nShit, you know we from Chicago, you know that's what we do\n\n\n[Bridge: Anna Wise]\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\n\n\n[Skit: Paula Duckworth]\nIf I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes\nCome back a man\nTell your story to these black and brown kids from Compton\nLet 'em know you was just like them\nBut you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person\nBut when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement\nAnd that's the best way to give back to your city\n\nAnd I love you Kendrick\nIf I don't hear you knocking on the door, you know where I usually leave the key, alright?\nTalk to you later, bye\n(*Sound of a cassette tape being stopped and fast forwarded*)"
