YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!\n\n[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]\nMan down, where you from?\n- Who you know! Where you from, my -?\nWhere your grandma stay, huh, my -?\nThis m.A.A.d city I run, my -\n\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nBrace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane\nThis is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine\nThis some cul-de-sac, plenty Cognac, or major brain\nThis no drill sergeant, no stress that weighin' on your brain\nIt was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan\nLucky ride down Rosecrans\nUgly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!\nUh, Warriors and Conans\n'Phorias can slow dance\n'Ciety, society, first one to get killed\nSee light-skinned homies with his brain blown out\nAt the same burger stand the homies hang out\nNow this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it\nBut ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different - Hey!\nBack when I was nine, Joey packed the nine\nPakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime\nPack a van with four guns at a time\nWith the sliding door, what is up?\nWhat you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up? Tell me, punk\nPickin' up the - uh - pump, pickin' off you suckers\nSuck a - what - die, sucker punch\nW of bullets comin' from\nAK's, AR's, \"Ayy, y'all, duck!\"\nThat's what Momma said when we was eatin' the free lunch\nAw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose\nYou killed my cousin back in '94, buck yo' truce!\nNow crawl your head in that noose\nYou wind up dead on the news\nAin't no peace treaty, pieces BG's up to pre-approve\nBodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's\nObviously, the coroner between the sheets - Hey!\nYou hop on that trolley - your colors correct\nYou're corporate - they'll be callin' your mother collect\nThe governor collect - our taxes, except\nIn traffic and traffic happens, that there ain't no threat\nYou movin' backwards, you suggest that you sleep with a TEC\nOr call a doctor, have a doctor on speed dial, I guess\nLet's get it!\n\n\n\n[Hook]\nMan down, where you from? Uh\nI said, fuck who you know, where you from my-?\nI said, where your grandma stay, huh, my -?\nThis m.A.A.d city I run, my-\n\n[Bridge 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nI said, if Pirus and Crips all got along\nProlly cut me down - end of the song\nSeem like the whole city go against me\nEvery time I'm in the street, I say—\nYAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!\"\n\n[Hook: Dan Reynolds, Kendrick Lamar, Both ]\nI'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones, Uh!\nTo make my systems blow, (Hah!)\nWelcome to the new age, (Oh!), to the new age, (Uh!)\nWelcome to the new age, to the new age, (Let's go! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!)\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive\n\n[Bridge 2: Dan Reynolds, Kendrick Lamar]\nAll systems go (Systems go)\nThe sun hasn't died (Doesn't die)\nDeep in my bones (In my bones)\nStraight from inside\n\n\n\n[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]\nOkay, tonight is to everybody understand me\nI need y'all to recognize that the plan B is to win your hearts right here, while we at the Grammys. My name is Kendrick Lamar\nWords like a sword in the hands of a Spartan in Compton, uh\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nBury me alive, bury me with pride\nBury me with berries, the forensic fuit, and cherry wine\nThank you berry much, but tonight's my night and I'm Barry Bonds\nSwingin' for the fences, barbaric Kendrick in idle time\nEverything in life subject to change, change whips, change grind\nChange clothes, change opinions, right before I change my mind\nI don't really know your business, been in there since I was bendin' Lego blocks\nNow you tell the world about me, dry snitch\nTater tots on my shotgun, I gotta pop one at the stars\nSky's the limit, I gotta finish as the first rapper on Mars\nMark my word, I'ma make my mark, when they start their Martial Law\nWhen these Martians presentate, alienate, [?]\nLord, look in my eyes, tell me I died, tell me I tried, to compromise\nTell me you love me, tell me that I, don't really care and can barely decide\nWishin' good luck on my enemies, energy go to the almighty God\nDrown in a bottle of Hennessy, with no amenity\nI'm gettin' better with time\nAaah!\n\n[Hook: Dan Reynolds, Kendrick Lamar, Both]\nI'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones (Oh!)\nTo make my systems blow (Yeah!)\nWelcome to the new age, to the new age, (Yeah!)\nWelcome to the new age, to the new age, (Yeah! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!)\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive (Ho!)\n\n\n\n[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]\nAnd can you feel me one time, yeah, can you see me?\nCan you feel me one time, yeah, can you?\n\n[Outro: Dan Reynolds]\nRadioactive, radioactive"
