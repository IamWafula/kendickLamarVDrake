    "Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)",
    "Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)",
    "Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)",
    "Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)",
    "I wanna stay, I wanna go 'round again",
    "Already been here too many times before",
    "And I wanna play, please let me stay, power's a game",
    "Don't wanna bend it, it defies the law",
    "And I want a place where I can go now and again",
    "Already been here too many times before",
    "And I'm gonna pay, please let me stay, power's the shame",
    "Gotta hold and mend it, it decries the fault",
    "When I lay down you can bet",
    "I have found where I wanna be",
    "And all around where I tread",
    "Are all the sounds that I found full of love for me",
    "It's so profound and you can bet",
    "That I have found where I wanna be",
    "And all the love in every breath",
    "All around, in my back, right in front of me",
    "Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)",
    "Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)",
    "Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)",
    "Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)",
    "This backward of ways, bad for the place, powers the flame",
    "Don't wanna waste this, they are tiresome, oh",
    "And I got a face that I could show now and again",
    "You 'ready seen far too many times for sure",
    "Now I got a space that I can lay now and again",
    "Already laid here too many times, oh Lord",
    "And I got a place, follow the race, power's the blame",
    "Gotta hold and mend it, it defies the law",
    "When I lay down you can bet",
    "I have found where I wanna be",
    "And all around where I tread",
    "Are all the sounds that I found full of love for me",
    "It's so profound and you can bet",
    "That I have found where I wanna be",
    "And all the love in every breath",
    "All around, in my back, right in front of me",
    "Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)",
    "Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)",
    "Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)",
    "Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)",
    "Too much, too many, too little time",
    "No search, no bad pennies, no crime",
    "Why you babysittin' only two or three shots?",
    "I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch",
    "First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it",
    "Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it",
    "I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock",
    "All the boys wanna play Baywatch",
    "I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it",
    "Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it",
    "Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)",
    "Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)",
    "Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)",
    "Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)"
