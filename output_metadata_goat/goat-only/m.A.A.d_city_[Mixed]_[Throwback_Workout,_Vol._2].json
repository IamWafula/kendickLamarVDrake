    "Man down, where you from, nigga?",
    "Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?",
    "Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?",
    "This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga",
    "Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane",
    "This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine",
    "This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain",
    "Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain",
    "It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans",
    "It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window, check yourself",
    "Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance",
    "With society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed",
    "Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out",
    "At the same burger stand where **** hang out",
    "Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it",
    "But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different",

    "Suck a dick or die or sucker punch",
    "A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, \"Ayy, y'all, duck\"",
    "That's what mama said when we was eatin' that free lunch",
    "Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose",
    "You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce",
    "Now crawl your head in that noose",
    "You wind up dead on the news",
    "Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve",
    "Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs",
    "Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys",
    "When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct",
    "Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be callin' your mother collect",
    "They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except",
    "When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat",
    "You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC",
    "Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess",
    "​m.A.A.d. city",
    "Man down, where you from, nigga?",
