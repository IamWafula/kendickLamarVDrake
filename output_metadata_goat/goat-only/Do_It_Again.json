    "Everyday I try to escape the realities of this world (world)",
    "So I tell a disc jockey \"press play\" while I press up on a girl (girl)",
    "In the midst of the smoke in the air",
    "The reflection of lights that glare",
    "She'll be out of control like a hydroplane",
    "In plain sight I might have to stare (shush)",
    "And that's power steering (uh)",
    "A power trip will see my appearance (uh)",
    "Pile of hundreds (uh) all on a prowl",
    "Like vampires in the darkest dungeon (uh)",
    "Speakers bumpin', drinks is pouring",
    "We in the house, we paid the mortgage, tyrannosaurus",
    "That's real big, pop my collar, pop that lid (uh)",
    "Flashin' lights, model types, vixen show me much love",
    "Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to",
    "Fire burning, heads is turning, all I see is energy",
    "So eventually",
    "We'll do this 'til the- (sun come up, the sun)",
    "We'll do this 'til the- (sun come up, the sun)",
    "Smoke like this 'til the- (sun come up, the sun)",
    "We'll do this 'til the moon is dropping day break watching",
    "Then do it again",
    "Some people stay home and sleep, me I go out at night (night)",
    "All seven days of the week, I live the party life (life)",
    "I got my dogs with me (with me)",
    "You can bring some of your friends",
    "We going hard 'til the sun come up and do it again",
    "I got a drink in my hand",
    "They playing my favorite song (favorite song)",
    "This girl that's dancing on me (on me)",
    "Ain't got no panties on (panties on)",
