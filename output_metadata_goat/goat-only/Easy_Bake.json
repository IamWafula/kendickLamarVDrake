This shit is fresh out the oven\nWhip game cold, man this shit 'bout to bubble\n\nBig bank rolls, either hate it or love it\nIt's anything goes, just as long as you thuggin'\nJust as long as you thuggin', yeah it's fresh out the oven\n\nWhip game cold, man this shit 'bout to bubble\n\nBig bank rolls, either hate it or love it\nIt's anything goes, just as long as you thuggin'\nJust as long as you thuggin'\nBig bank rolls, just as long as you thuggin'\n\nWhip game cold, just as long as you thuggin'\n\n\n[Verse 2: Jay Rock]\nI pull up and park, hop out and swag\nGrab the Glock out the trunk, other Glock in the stash\nJust a regular nigga, with no chains or nothin'\nIf I do get some shines, you try to snatch\nThere's repercussions, and concussions\nYou know what's after that, end of discussions\nI came a long way from eatin' free lunches\n\nFrom Mary County checks to makin' these numbers\nOh Lord, I'm just reminiscin'\nCould it be some intervention on some inner vision?\nI don't know, 'cause I'm just goin' with the flow\nWhatever's required, I got it goin' for the low\n\n\n\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Jay Rock]\n\nAh, I parted ways with my old self, I'm a new man\n\nNew face with a new stone and the blue van\nBlew weight on a bad day with my loosie\n\nSuitcase full of merchandise, that's my new plan\nThis my new wave, this my new tan\nThis my summer days in the tropics by the cool sand\nThis my shakin' down you niggas' pockets, I don't do friends\n\nAnd I don't do trends\nFuck it though I'll ride with you then!\nBring the troops in\nI'll fuck around and let 'em loose then\n\nWe'll give 'em blues then\nOh fuck it, call me Bobby \"Blue\" Bland\n\nAye you a fool man\nRidin' by you, swervin' at the intersection\nBaby come and get your blessin'\nAnd she gon' fuck with this erection\n\nI got somethin' good for all these hoes\nShe gotta want the Betty 'fore I call these hoes\nNow if I paid for your dress and your perm\nThat means you an investment, bitch\nI'ma need my dough in return\n\n[Part II]\n\n\n\n[Radio Interlude]\n\nWe reporting live from the 9 double 0-5-9 with my nigga Jay Rock and this is WTOP Radio and I'm your host DJ Turn-Up\nI don't turn down nuttin' but my collar\nI ain't turnin' down no money\nAnd I ain't turnin' down no mothafuckin' fade\nNow bitch if you're pushin' up the freak with your orangutan-lookin' ass, take some advice and bang SZA ya flat-foot bitch\n\n\n[Verse 1: SZA]\n\nItchin' for a climax lasting past 11:30\nDo you got it like that, do you really got it like that?\nItchin' for a purpose, I can't seem to scratch the surface\nI ain't got it like that, do I really got it like that?\nYou keep talkin' 'bout time, I got none\nYou can find me where\nThe sun don't never end and the waves don't part\n\nYou don't pay enough of my rent, don't start\nI got big dreams and you got quick scheme to get rich quickly\nAnd I don't wanna waste another hour\nReally need to take another shower\nDirty for you\n\n\n[Verse 2: Jay Rock]\nNow this that big shell fishscale\nBMX on the ramp with the fishtail\nPegs on the front, we gon' get there\nWe 4 deep at a swapmeet, don't need a 5th wheel\nThis bitch steal whoever if situations get real\nThis that fresh out the bounty, bustin' knuckles\nGet buckled if you ever try to knock the hustle\nShow your hands, watch how I shuffle (No cuts)\nAnd show you why they hate more niggas than Uncle Ruckus\nRollin' up that boondock, some call it moon rock\n\nGotta keep that bass in my step, dope in a tube sock\nGotta do what I do to remain on\nSo all a nigga need is good love when I come home\nCause the baby's gotta eat, baby the rent's been due lately\nAnd I just caught a hot one, I ain't tryna go too brazy\nFugazi, not me, me and my niggas not sweet\nGive you thug passion\n, how you walkin' around knock-kneed\nI'm the silver bullet movin' at top speed\nShow you how to get it and get away with it scott free"
