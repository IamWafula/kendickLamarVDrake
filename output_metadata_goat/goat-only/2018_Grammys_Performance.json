Not your father, not your brother\nNot your reason, not your future\nNot your comfort, not your reverence, not your glory\nNot your heaven, not your angel, not your spirit\nNot your message, not your freedom\nNot your people, not your neighbor\nNot your baby, not your equal\nNot the title y'all want me under\nAll hail King Killmonger"
