    "…now",
    "Where danger finds me, it follows with tides",
    "Many miles ahead of me, still I'm in stride",
    "She said",
    "“Hey, little buddy, where you goin’?”",
    "I’m not sure, all I know is that I’m falling",
    "This ain’t regular, I seen regular",
    "These streams may take me out to the ocean…"
