Brother, not you\nNot true? Why you think dem call dem babylon?\n'Cause them just agents of a system\nTwist one up, get your fist up in the air\nDiallo, Bell, and Villanueva, I say a prayer\nI wonder, do they include all the police murders\nWhen they go and calculate the murder rate each year?\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Jonathan Emile & Kendrick Lamar]\nYou see, the beast starts sprayin', that's what I'm sayin', dem not playin'\nLord, Heaven help dem, Heaven help dem (Yeah, yeah)\nSee di man dem pon di corner, gun cocked, ready to draw\nWhen dem face in front of Jah, God\nHeaven help dem, Heaven help dem (It's Kendrick Lamar, from Compton to Montreal)\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nThey all say the average Black man only live 'til twenty-five\nPac died at twenty-five\nHow many kids you know dead at twenty? Five?\n\nNow that's life, I know ten that's crumblin' in coffins\n\nDead as a doorknob\n\nFresh out of high school and couldn't find no job, went straight to the grave\n\nIt's crazy how the grim reaper in love with such tender age\n\nI think about it as I gaze upon my ceiling\nHe woke up, brushed his teeth, then jumped in the shower\nStared at the mirror after he dried his face with a towel and said\n\"This can be the day I might pass away\nFrom an altercation my homie got into yesterday\nOr mistaken identity, him thinkin' I was his enemy\nWhen I never seen him a day in my life\"\nThis is life for a young Black man\nWith his future and his burner in his hand\nWhile you on your grind, keep this in mind, we say\n\n\n\n[Verse 3: Jonathan Emile & Kendrick Lamar]\nHeaven help the man who takes another man's life (Yeah)\nHeaven help the man who makes the other man fight (Yeah)\nHeaven help the man who fears the other man\nBecause he got a tan or he Black or he white (That's Jonathan Emile by the way)\nHeaven help the mama who just lost her baby\nBy the guns and the justice that was there for safety (MindPeaceLove Records)\nAnd Heaven knows just why they had to take his life (Kendrick Lamar, take 'em home, uh)\nAnd people are angry and people want answers\nHe wasn't a nuisance, he wasn't a gangster\nThey want justice in these streets\nBut there seems to be no justice for police and so\nHeaven help the man who crush another man will\nHeaven help the man who make another man kill\nHelp the rioters who is goin' crazy\nIn the streets, all they're really screamin' out is, \"Save me\"\n\n[Chorus: Jonathan Emile]\nYou see, the beast starts sprayin', that's what I'm sayin', dem not playin'\nLord, Heaven help dem, Heaven help dem\nSee di man dem pon di corner, gun cocked, ready to draw (Kendrick Lamar, I want to thank you very much for doing this song with me)\nWhen dem face in front of Jah, God\nHeaven help dem, Heaven help dem (It's Jonathan Emile, 514, stand up)\nYou see, the beast starts sprayin', that's what I'm sayin', dem not playin'\nLord, Heaven help dem, Heaven help dem\nSee di man dem pon di corner, gun cocked, ready to draw (Franco Proietti on the alto saxophone)\nWhen dem face in front of Jah, God\nHeaven help dem, Heaven help dem (Jonathan Emile on the beat)\nYou see, the beast starts sprayin', that's what I'm sayin', dem not playin' (This goes out to anybody who was ever a victim of abuse of power)\nLord, Heaven help dem, Heaven help dem (Hate)\nSee di man dem pon di corner, gun cocked, ready to draw (Violence)\nWhen dem face in front of Jah, God\nHeaven help dem (It's time to stand up), Heaven help dem\n\n\n\n[Outro: Jonathan Emile]\nFerguson (Ayy), to the world (Ah)\nMontreal, New York (Ayy)\nDem killin' da people dem\nLyin' to the people all the time (Ah)\nInna da streets, you see a rainbow\nWe're marchin' for our rights (Woo)"
