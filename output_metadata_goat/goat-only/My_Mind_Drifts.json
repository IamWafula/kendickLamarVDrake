    "The song was produced by the Quartermaine.",
    "As my mind drift and then split",
    "Like the middle of a spliff",
    "I begin to catapult off the cliff of the unknown",
    "I got a feeling in my funny bone–that we're not the same",
    "Just antonyms of another age",
    "My soul flock with the carefree",
    "Words of the wise, I spoke a hundred times like a gold D",
    "Haha LMFAO",
    "I hate y'all, but I spread love like mayo",
    "Then spread slugs",
    "My brain matter is a brain phantom",
    "See my vision, or my vision'll stare at ya",
    "This is the future if I say so",
    "You copping fitted caps, I'm about to go and cop a halo",
    "The God of rap and I mean it",
    "And I play football with Mars, and marbles with Pluto and Venus",
    "Witness the genius",
    " – I interact",
    "With the inner city villains that enters your system like a computer hack",
    "Then give you dap"
