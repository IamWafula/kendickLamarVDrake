When You Could Be.. taking me... down!\n\n\n[Verse 1: Kent]\nHell nah, hell nah\nYou got me fucked up like Jim Bean\n\nAnd your second toe is bigger than your big toe\nChillin in the studio high, puma clydes resting on knees\nShe keep bbm'ing me get home but I'mma fucking G\nGirl please\nYou ain't even my girlfriend quit\nThat type of shit gets you kicked out the in crowd quick\nTwo fingers together just like yo legs I make em split\nShe said I'm broke. And Hopeless\nYo best friend lemme hit DEST\nLast laugh, watch me stack cash\nSince you won't let me work file transfer some pictures of that ass\nMore Kush and wine\nWaking up next to two dimes\nI smoke one and poke one\nThey both hell as fine\n\n[Verse 2: Joon]\nWell I scooped her up like a spoon\nTold her I'm June\nGood if ya nasty\nBut I be on my grind so ya can't see me all the time, but when I come baby, I come DEEP,like the trail of tears baby\nYou understand me?\nThey told me you stingy if you smoking on anything that's less than a dime\nAnd you miccy if you pokin anything that's less than 9\nYou live in LA!! and I know In you I found something special\nWe connect so many levels\nBut endeavors for the cheddar got me bed-less and you the wettest\nI really wish I could be there I wouldn't be jus trynna pull yo leggings\nCause you know my every fetish\nAnd what I love to eat for breakfast\nAnd it damn well eggs it ain't Even on the nobody's checklist\nBUT MINE\nI'll be there in the blink of an eye girl quite whining\nLemme get these dollars\n\n\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Sleezy]\nEveryday we back and fourth with the same discussion\nSay I act like you ain't nothin\nGirl you buggin thought we had it clear I ain't tryna be yo husband\nThem feelings got you wishin it was Somethin that it wasn't\nWhy you spazz when you here I'm in the club from yo cousin?\nBut she ain't tell you she was on me too she be frontin\nMan I really shoulda done it, let her blow me like a trumpet\nBut you be bitchin cuz these bitches in yo ear bumpin gums like\n\"why he always in the studio?!\"\nGot me feeling guilty I ain't even in the mood to flow\nDamn you so predictable sending text wit ya flesh exposed now I'm ret to go\nWhen I see that ass girl bets believe its goin down\n\n[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]\nMy woman be trippin sometimes\nI remember her strippin off martin and sipping on some of the cheapest of wine\nWhich way we gone climb? I'm tryna get higher but you desire land mines, Blow Up\nEvery time I'm, In Clubs tryna network my social\nLife like I'm supposed to but I'm wrong\nTo you I'm very wrong, but you don't get it, and you won't admit it you say I'm like your ex but I think were nothing different\nShe gave me them digits\nBut I didn't call, I put that on me\nAnd yo girlfriends, I know they throw salt like Angelina Jolie, now let's see\nI'll be gone til Wednesday, gotta show in Portland\nNow my baby, say I ain't her baby\nBut more of an abortion I'm like that's crazy\nI bought that Lexo, and sat it on Jordans\nNow miss lady, if promoters don't pay me\nThen we can't afford it\nForging signatures on fake check\nIt ain't life if I don't break sweat\nTo break these mics on every set\nIt's ironic I'm Tryna stay grounded at the same time still fly these jets\nHello, goodbye marro rodeo\n\nIt's funny you had a great, but still you took ungrateful\n\n\n\nChorus"
