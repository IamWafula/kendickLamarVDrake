    "It's big TM, leanin' off the Seagrams",
    "Eyes bloodshot, look at 'em and you'll see him",
    "Now who he's become but his mother's son?",
    "The same one who avoided guns and picked up the drums",
    "Had you marchin' to a different beat, stood you on your feet",
    "I looked out, helped you off the streets",
    "I gave you advice to heed, a new life to lead",
    "In return, you took my kindness for weak",
    "When I was at my lowest, truest colors started showin'",
    "Niggas I called friends wasn't answerin' they phone then",
    "Huh, that's when Quik words rang true",
    "Be careful who you hand your celebrity to, uh",
    "Didn't get it 'til that very instance",
    "Since then, between me and them, I put a little distance",
    "Niggas so lame for sayin', \"Bro, it's a shame\"",
    "Disloyal like a ho, sold your soul for this game and you still broke, nigga",
    "Sometimes, people go as quick as they come",
    "They say that there's nothing new under the sun",
    "'Cause time reveals all our reasons",
    "Things change in life just like seasons",
    "Little Kendrick from the Hub",
    "Can show you that my motives always been to give you love",
    "I'm puttin' out good music in return to build a buzz",
    "That's bigger than life itself or some Bubble Kush plug",
    "Won't you look in the mirror?",
    "You see a pair of eyes that's quite similar to mines",
    "And if you do, that shit should scare ya",
    "Baby brother of Compton, tryna accomplish",
    "The impossible, with obstacles at my daily grindin'",
    "Oh no, here come the critics, but not from the magazines, I mean",
    "The blocks that were so-called mad at me, they're mean",
    "'Cause soon as success is in my favor",
    "They'll try to break down my character like I ain't from their heritage",
    "Quite frankly",
    "It'd hurt my soul to hear a nigga that I know talkin' bad and tryna play me",
    "Like we ain't had pellet gunfights, fallin' off of minibikes",
    "In the Buick, bumpin' Clipse with no AC",
    "Why would you shame me?",
    "Sometimes, people go as quick as they come",
    "They say that there's nothing new under the sun",
    "'Cause time reveals all our reasons",
    "Things change in life just like seasons",
    "Yeah, mm",
    "So I was drivin' home last night on the 101 freeway and I look up",
    "And it's a sign that says, \"Love your friends and love your family\"",
    "And I thought to myself, why do we use these words so loose? Love, friends, and family",
    "I mean if love is involved, why do friends and family hurt us, and why do we hurt them?",
    "It's kinda like we all forgot the true definition of love to begin with, tuh",
    "The one thing I do know, I nor you can be accountable what somebody else does to us",
    "We can only be accountable for what we do to them",
    "So instead of sayin', \"That's my friend,\" \"That's my family,\" and, \"It's love,\" huh",
    "I'ma say this to y'all",
    "So many words we say in vain",
    "What are we really sayin'?",
    "People never change",
    "Truth won't be the same"
