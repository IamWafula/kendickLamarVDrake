    "Don't wait too long",
    "I don't wanna wait 'til the moment's gone",
    "I don't wanna play that same love song",
    "Over and over (Yeah)",
    "Started out good, ended up bad",
    "You like a pop song all stuck up in my head",
    "Finally read the lyrics, understood what they meant",
    "When I spent all my money on my goddamn rent",
    "Now I'm tryna figure out if it was worth it",
    "Matter fact, I know the answer and it was no, bitch",
    "Chilling on the island with my feet up on the beach (Hey)",
    "But being raised on the beach couldn't prepare me for these bitches",
    "And these sand sharks and how they try to sink they teeth in",
    "I'm just bodysurfing, tryin' not to hit the reef",
    "All they wanna see a brother do is sink",
    "But I'ma ride this shit 'til my shit don't stink",
    "I'ma sing my heart out, sing 'til I can't breathe",
    "I'ma mean every note, even if it's off-key",
    "Please go 'head and leave",
    "I wouldn't wait for you, so don't wait for me",
    "Don't wait too long",
    "I don't wanna wait 'til the moment's gone",
    "I don't wanna play that same love song",
    "Over and over",
    "If I didn't rhyme with Sony, would you still wanna bone me?",
    "How come in the full room, I can still feel lonely?",
    "My grandmama said watch out for them phonies",
    "And them motherfuckers say, \"Ese,\" just tryna be your homies",
    "When they see you on top (Ayy)",
    "They want a little piece of it, but they ain't gettin' nothin'",
    "It's goin' to my nieces and my cousins",
    "I'm havin' babies by the dozens",
    "Pop 'em out the oven like an Egg McMuffin",
    "Always up to nothin' (Nothin')",
    "But, baby, you're somethin' (Somethin')",
    "Like it when you're bumpin' down the street in your pumpkin",
    "Wishin' it was just you and me in the moment",
    "I'm thinkin' that it's summer",
    "You sippin' a Corona and I'm hummin'",
    "A song that you love and you tell me that you love it",
    "Just then, we feel the buzz and our bodies start touchin'",
    "Even though I know how it ends, I don't want to interrupt it (Nah)",
    "Don't wait too long",
    "I don't wanna wait 'til the moment's gone",
    "I don't wanna play that same love song",
    "Over and over",
    "Over and over like a record that's broken",
    "Over and over like you say that we're through",
    "Over and over, over and over, I came back to you",
    "And now it's over, over",
    "Welcome to the story of my life, the miseducation of Kendrick",
    "Stressin', Hennessy shots, throw 'em back like it's vintage",
    "Wonderin' can I live? Where is the generosity?",
    "Somethin' just gotta give, tryna stay positive",
    "My motive's to be a mogul",
    "Searchin' for a dollar without compromisin' my vocals",
    "Really, I'm just a noble kid from the Westside of Compton",
    "My cousins was selling crack while we played Sonic",
    "You niggas is nonsense, I say that you full of shit",
    "And need a colonic or maybe the Heimlich",
    "Maneuver to throw up what you consume",
    "My shine is bright enough to make a dead flower bloom in a room full of curtains",
    "I'm for certain that I'm certainly poppin' the pistol verbally",
    "And never will I get shot",
    "Your aim is all fucked up as if your sidekick dropped",
    "I'm nice with it, bro-bro",
    "Over and over again, you know who I do it for",
    "Me",
    "Don't wait too long (Don't wait too long)",
    "I don't wanna wait 'til the moment's gone (Don't wait too long)",
    "I don't wanna play that same love song",
    "Over and over",
    "Over and over like a record that's broken",
    "Over and over like you say that we're through",
    "Over and over, over and over, I came back to you",
    "And now it's over, over"
