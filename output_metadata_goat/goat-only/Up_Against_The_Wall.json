    "Crack's in your pocket, weed in your pocket",
    "Dope in your pocket, who the hell could stop it?",
    "You can't get caught with, so you might want it locked in",
    "I never thought you'd find me",
    "I never thought you'd see me",
    "Crack's in your pocket, weed in your pocket (I never thought you'd find me)",
    "Dope in your pocket, who the hell could stop it?",
    "Up against the wall, against the wall, against the wall",
    "It was around 2 at night, I saw the blue and whites",
    "There was one Black officer and two were white",
    "And I'll admit that I was wrong, 'cause I blew the light",
    "But I figured the Black one was out to prove he white",
    "And he'd prove me right and wouldn't do me right",
    "So when I rolled the window down, he wasn't too polite",
    "Matter fact, he was screamin' at the top of his tonsils",
    "I said, \"Sir, there's no need to be this hostile\"",
    "\"Well, Mr. Cons, you got late registration\"",
    "I said, \"It's me, Cons, from Late Registration\"",
    "He looked at me like I ain't take my medication",
    "And this was the cause of his detonation",
    "He told me, \"Step away from the vehicle\"",
    "This is becomin' way too much to read into",
    "He called for backup, so what you expected me to do?",
    "To stand there like a horse at a feeding zoo?",
    "Nah, I did what my feet should do",
    "I tried to bolt, but then the white one put the nine millimeter to my throat",
    "And told me, \"Freeze or you'll be risking it all\"",
    "And that's how I wound up",
    "Up against the wall, against the wall, against the wall",
    "I never thought you'd find me",
    "I never thought you'd see me",
    "Crack's in your pocket, weed in your pocket (I never thought you'd find me)",
    "Dope in your pocket, who the hell could stop it?",
    "Up against the wall, against the wall, against the wall (Yeah)",
    "Caught red-handed, ridin' with the cannon",
    "Schemin' and scammin', livin' like Reggie Hammond",
    "A phantom, snapshots from the man's Canon",
    "Pigs got my pictures on the wall like a parent",
    "I be disappearin', but the cameras",
    "Will catch you doin' dirt if you be careless",
    "You gotta be more aware of it",
    "To save yourself the embarrassment of gettin' caught carryin'",
    "They hit my homie with calendars, he was talented",
    "And I'm still fightin' cases out in Maryland and breakin' up marriages",
    "Like packages of white like Marilyn",
    "Still dabble in the crack game, baggin' it",
    "Feds in the palaces, searchin' through the cabinets",
    "I'm a capitalist, get off that faggot shit",
    "My establishment, that's rather fabulous",
    "Police threw us in the paddy wagon like savages",
    "I never thought you'd find me",
    "I never thought you'd see me",
    "Crack's in your pocket, weed in your pocket (I never thought you'd find me)",
    "Dope in your pocket, who the hell could stop it?",
    "Up against the wall, against the wall, against the wall",
    "Yeah, this shit got me feelin' kinda like Sunday evenin'",
    "On the pulpit, me and my heathens",
    "Me and Consequence circle your seven continents all in one weekend",
    "Make sure your proposal is decent, get exposed to treason",
    "The last of the dyin' Mohicans when mentionin' rappers",
    "My niggas'll rat-tat-tat you, then kiss your mother right after",
    "Disaster'll strike faster than a thief in the night",
    "The thesis of a Black man, policemen never could write",
    "That's why our backs against the walls, gun raised",
    "Takin' out everything like bank withdrawals before the year 2K",
    "And by the end of the day, I'll be America's most wanted",
    "Shot and confronted while runnin' from the CIA",
    "Livin' life as a rebel",
    "The last Panther stuck in the ghetto",
    "Tuckin' the metal like junkyards and rockstars",
    "The smoke never settles where I'm from",
    "From a tree to the cornerstores is where we hung, uh",
    "I never thought you'd find me",
    "I never thought you'd see me",
    "Crack's in your pocket, weed in your pocket (I never thought you'd find me)",
    "Dope in your pocket, who the hell could stop it?",
    "Up against the wall, against the wall, against the wall"
