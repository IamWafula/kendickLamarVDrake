Kendrick Lamar is featured on the song, but uncredited and he only… Read More \n[Intro]\nThey felt like they were laying tracks, for the generation to come. I think my mother knew that freedom wouldn't come in her lifetime, just like I know it won't come in mine. It's a matter of, either we stay like this or somebody sacrifice, somebody laying tracks, so we can stay in a 360 degree. Deadly circle, somebody used to break out and risk, you know losing everything and being poor and getting deep down. Cause someone has to do something, had I had a father, had I had some of these opportunities. I would be able to handle my mother more\n\n\n[Verse 1: Punch]\nI was taught never trust a nigga, far as you can see him\nTeach a nigga how to fish, as apposed to try'na feed him\n\nLook a man in the eyes, that's the best way to read him\nCause faces they change, but point of views remain\n\nI got a strange feeling, that I'm a lil bit different\nBeyond the customs and tradition of a project living\nMy Korean war vet, grandfather's affliction\nWas stress and I inherited his heart condition\n\nAnd Van Arthur's addiction, was heroin needles\n\nPetty hustling, d'evils, that street men lust\nSo I'm mixed with that lethal combination but trust\nI've only scratched the surface\n, what's underneath this verse is\nThe feeling of a young boy lost, without a purpose\nStill waters run deep in the street we were submerged in\nPolice lurking, try'na catch a nigga serving\n\nHe ain't going back to jail, so he bust a verse\n\n[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]\nThis is for my everyday young nigga\nIt don't really matter where you from niggas\nBefore you leave the house, kiss your moms nigga\nCause you don't know when that day'll come nigga\nCause only Lord knows that I know how you feel\n\nWhat we gotta do just to live\nIs try not to get our cap peeled, try not to get your cap peeled\n\n\n\n[Verse 2: Punch]\nIt's hard to get to know me, unless you hear between bars\n\nTortured soul self contained on my childhood scars\nI was involved from a far, affected by the street laws\nConcrete walls, not even earthquakes could shake them brick walls\nNickerson garden projects this is me y'all\n\nWhere Dope dealers have it all and then freefall\nCaine numbs the pain up and down the ghetto seesaw\nThe voice of the youth, they hear me and they see y'all\nThey don't see a diamond in the rough, they see flaws\nThey should see how we was raised and they would be in awe\nAgainst all it gets hard not to kill niggas\nIt's like a full-time job not to grab the semi-auti\nAnd go kamikaze on somebody who plotting\nProbably on my body laying lifeless, ungodly sacrifices\n\nTo the streets, this is the trinity\nMoney malice and murder the hood's deity\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey say the average black man only lives to 25\nWell I made it past that and a nigga still alive\n\nWhich means I'm in the red, I'm indebted to death\nThat's the wages that sin pay, I'm still tracing my steps\n\nLeaving my footprints in the sand, the concrete rose\nThat grew on infertile land and blossomed to a grown man\n\nMy only fear is pops holding moms hand\nDripping tears on my casket, I refuse to let it happen\nBy any means avoiding the city traffic\nShooters got the green light, they blocking your right of passage\nA young kid turned savage, city madness\nA picture painted on the street's canvas, excuse my brashness\n\nI'm trying to live to see past this\nStaring at the world and my rear view past tense\n\nIn no particular fashion, I'm on borrowed time I'mma grind with a passion\n\n\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nGeneration to generation to come\nThey won't come in mind\nSacrifices, sacrifices, sacrifices\nDeadly circle, deadly circle"
