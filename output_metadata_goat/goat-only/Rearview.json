    "How can I change the world, but can't change myself?",
    "How can I please the world but not God himself?",
    "How can I have the world, still need some help?",
    "How can I see the world, stuck in this box?",
    "I've been trying to figure out my life",
    "I can't see, even in plain sight",
    "Though I cry, my tears don't bring light",
    "Your life is in your rearview",
    "How can I change the world, but can't change myself?",
    "How can I please the world, but not God himself?",
    "How can I lead the world when I'm scared to try?",
    "Why should I need the world? We all gon' die",
    "I thank God for giving us this life",
    "The day you're born, someone else dies",
    "All in love, all is in life",
    "Your life is in your rearview",
    "Your life is in your rearview",
    "Your life is in your rearview",
    "Your life is in your rearview",
    "Your life is in your rearview",
    "Your life is in your rearview",
    "Your life is in your rearview",
    "Your life is in your rearview",
    "Your life is in your rearview",
    "Your life is in your rearview"
