The morning rides keep me on a hill of silence.\n\nI go months without a phone.\n\nLove, loss, and grief have disturbed my comfort zone, but the glimmers of God speak through my music and family.\n\nWhile the world around me evolves, I reflect on what matters the most. The life in which my words will land next.\n\nAs I produce my final TDE album, I feel joy to have been a part of such a cultural imprint after 17 years. The Struggles. The Success. And most importantly, the Brotherhood. May the Most High continuе to use Top Dawg as a vessel for candid crеators. As I continue to pursue my life's calling.\n\nThere's beauty in completion. And always faith in the unknown.\n\nThank you for keeping me in your thoughts. I've prayed for you all.\n\nSee you soon enough.\n\n-oklama"
