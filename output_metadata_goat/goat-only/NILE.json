    "One time, I took a swim in the Nile",
    "I swam the whole way, I didn't turn around",
    "Man, I swear",
    "It made me relax when I came down",
    "I felt liberated like free birds, I'm stimulated now",
    "Plunging away 'less my body's on top",
    "All of these currents might cost me my life right now",
    "When danger finds me, it follows with tides",
    "Many miles ahead of me, still I'm in stride",
    "She said",
    "Hey little buddy, where you goin'?",
    "I'm not sure, but I know I'm still in motion",
    "This ain't regular, I seen regular",
    "These streams may take me out to the ocean",
    "Told myself if I dive in it without precaution of a lifejacket",
    "Then I'll dive in it 'til I am exhausted and I'm type lacking",
    "Waistline on four deep, senses on 4D",
    "Feel like there's four me",
    "One time, I took a swim in the Nile (One time, I took in a swim in the Nile; one time)",
    "I swam the whole way, I didn't turn around",
    "Man, I swear (I swear, I swear)",
    "It made me relax when I came down (When I came down)",
    "I felt liberated like free birds, I'm stimulated now (Stimulated)",
    "Plunging away 'less my body's on top (Stimulated, stimulated now; On top)",
    "All of these currents might cost me my life right now (Right now, right now)",
    "Where danger finds me, it follows with tides (Follows with tides; stimulated right now)",
    "Many miles ahead of me, still I'm in stride",
    "That's some good",
    "Got the Nile runnin' through my body",
    "Look at my natural, I'm so exotic",
    "Darker the berry, sweeter the fruit",
    "Deeper the wounded, deeper the roots",
    "Nubian doused in brown, I'm lounging in it",
    "Fountain of Youth, I said I'm drowning in it",
    "I'm in the Nile, deep in denial",
    "I'm in the Nile, deep in denial",
    "That's some good"
