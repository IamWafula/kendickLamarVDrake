Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)\nYou can get snaked, you can get faked out by the bitch that you feelin'\n'Cause you thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee\nAnd you tell her your business, she tell me your business, you tell that bitch what you feelin'\nAll of the beans you be spillin', to you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's\nShe know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden, she know when you're gone, tell me when to visit\nWe break in your home and take the specifics, and meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with you\nSo she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains, we find out addresses, and we don't leave messes\nYou'll only know that it's gone when you checkin', then your first thought is to start second guessin'\nShe say, \"What's wrong?\" He say, \"Nothin', keep restin',\" she say, \"What's missin'?\" \"How you know somethin' missin'?\"\nHe scratched his head, she say, \"Get back in bed,\" then she gave him some head\nBoy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say, \"Ooh, daddy, ooh\", woo\nShe say, \"Ooh, daddy, ooh,\" yeah, she took off his pants and his shoes\nHe opened his eyes and saw that barrel goin' \"boom,\" nigga, yeah\n\n\n\n[Refrain: Lil Wayne]\nI see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles\nGettin' drunk with these bitches, and when they leave, they get followed\nI be with bitches that know the bitches, that's with the niggas we followin'\nGet them on the line, stay two cars behind, and tell them hoes, \"Don't be so obvious\"\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]\nMona Lisa, long hair, don't care\nShe handle the business and don't ever tell, she bite the bullet and cough up the shells\nShe tell him, \"Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,\" and if he say yeah, then we meet him there\nShe don't want love, she just want her share, she feed him lies with his silverware\n\nI know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is\nSo he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears, and then she tell me and I be all ears\nAnd then I go and tell my people, and they already know him, and then I call Liz, and she say he comin' over\nI say, \"Good girl, just remember what I told you,\" she say, \"Yes, daddy\", I say, \"Girl, you're a soldier\"\nSo we're waitin' outside, we watched him pull up, and walk up to the door\nAnd right before he knock, she open the door naked, they started French kissin', but he didn't see moi\nShe left it unlocked, they didn't make it to the room, so they stopped on the couch\n\nMusic up loud with his head in the clouds, turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him\nPiss a nigga off, shoot him dead in his frown\n\"Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around, I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down\nYou know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up, Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down\"\nThen he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her, she a good actress and you a dead actor\nYou'll be dead after we get what we after, if Liz call you daddy, we call her a bastard, oh\n\nI got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga, but think for me, nigga\nSend her to you like she ain't for me, nigga, and if you alone, she bankrupts you niggas\n\nShe pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga, she slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga\nThen you wake up and see guns in your face, and Mona Lisa out of frame on these niggas\n\nThat pussy got you out of character, nigga, you fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga\nWe take everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion, we have yo' attention\n\nAnd now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga, you more terrified than a Fatter Joe, nigga\nDon't be a pussy for pussy, my nigga, don't be a asshole over pantyhose, nigga, quit playin'\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Lil Wayne]\nShe say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa\nOoh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa\nShe say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa\nNow he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah\n\n\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]\nAh, every day she wake up with a different color makeup and a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall\nChillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter, four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball\nPaparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh, probably on a Internet blog\nIn a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow\n\nPussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls\nAnd he diggin' in it like he livin' in it, make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God\nPoetry in the pear trees, sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him\nDid he want to make love in a yellow taxi? Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat\nWoke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby, then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie\nI'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing, I'ma call up again like I did last week\nMake good with the friend and I'm all jazzy, Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley\nFound out that I fucked, he was unhappy, bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me\nBetter yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me 'bout no motherfuckin' double-standard, acting\nFucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone, but you sucked his dick, that's just nasty\nMatter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No) You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)\nBitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick) (… lick me like a lollipop)\nHe on your fuckin' ringtone? Is that the shit that you do? Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos\nJump on the internet, watchin' his interviews, I don't know what the fuck lately got into you\nTell me who love you, I bet I love harder, forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?\nThe Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma, daycare after school and she never did charge you\nYou scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up, you know what, I give up, let me go get my gun\nI got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin', goddammit, you know that the damage is done\nBitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress, I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess\nSo in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy, I'm killin' myself\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Lil Wayne]\nShe say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa\nOoh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa\nShe say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa\nNow he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah"
