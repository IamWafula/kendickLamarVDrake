Oreo\n\nI feel like Klever to Cy, cuz I'm going raw on you\n\nI know I speak Toronto, but I'm Smiley?\nNot true\n\nI'm at the top, bitch, I'm feelin' like A1\n\nI'ma paint Sick's toes, make her feel like art, got it droppin' like day 1\nWhen I saw Chiaura come to me, that's the first human I ever jacked to\n\nMight get Coppola to shoot the vid, so I can label it \"Jack 2\"\n\nYesterday I was asking why I hate guys like you, guess I'm Jack too\nI'd get ReactBot on the beat, but there's no mobile Jack, dude\n\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus: LoonaGooner]\nDropped message to Matti from Brendon Urie\n\n[Chorus 2: LoonaGooner & Brendon Urie]\n\nStop there, and let me correct it\nI wanna live a life from a new perspective\nYou come along because I love your face\nAnd I'll admire your expensive taste, and\nWho cares? Divine intervention\nI wanna be praised from a new perspective\nBut leaving now would be a good idea\nSo catch me up on gettin' out of here\n\n[Interlude: Black Sans]\nAw damn, LG, I think I- I think I damn caught the shitty boy virus\n\n[Verse 2: Black Sans]\nProductions year boy tryna play with my Wii U\nI say see you, and all my friends will agree too\nAin't nobody like your begging, your whole subculture, it been my circus\nI've been dropping hit after hit, while you can't even record a bit of dissin'\nWhen you're wagin' war on Sans, you're wagin' war with Stefan\nThis my whole fuckin' universe\n, you just own a farm\nE-I-E-I-O, repeat my shit while I go\nTake a diarrhea dump on your brain, I think I may have made it better bro\nWorld War 3's the last thing I'm promoting on YouTube Shorts reposts\nI wanna let everyone be heard, when I give them chairs and a show to host\nWhy don't you just press delete?\nWhy don't you just go be movie buddies with Mightypupsfanboy instead of targeting me?\n\nAll I hear is \"erm\"s and \"actually\"s from your banner, you freak\nIf you're rapping, you're only spitting on Cyraxx beats\n\nFavorite rappers prolly the ones from ERB\nWhen you gonna move on? When the track might be dropping\nOver here roleplaying in comments, that's why you stay in fiction more than facts\nYou go to your parents and try to sleep with a nap, some warm milk to relax\nI roll up to your damn window, hit a tap tap tap\nAnd the whole house is Left Eye, have em BLAP BLAP BLAP\nWrite a letter, Stan the Third, have me read it verbatim\nI'll finally let the racism in you stay overtaken\nRest of the mixtape ain't gon' mention you, these disses cheese and bacon\nQuit your whole career before you end up being all mistaken\nKiwi Farms your new fans, I say \"Hi there\"\nBeating women the only time you'll ever get care\nBlack Sans the king of the underground, you the sacrificial lamb\nAnd that's the channel deletion right there with your name in the sand\n\n\n\n[Verse 3: Uncle Steve]\nHere we go now\nTell me, what you really wanna do?

Oh, there he is!\nThe fact you even have a fanbase is hilarious\nLook at me, I'm dropping words of certainty\nYour brain is so small, it's the size of a bumblebee\nPlease don't try to step to me, I'll win this battle easily\nNever try to beef with me\nI'll K.O. you breezily\nMy games are like the grass\nIt's always greener\nI never placed last cause I'm the winner\n\n[Verse 9: Sonic]\nWin against me? You must be insane\nYou're jealous, cause all your games are lame\nTry to catch up to me, you're way too slow\nYou eat mushrooms daily, but still can't grow?\nI can outrun you on your best day with my dash\nWhen will you realize Nintendo milks you for cash\nEven your mother can tell you that you're trash\nI'll reduce you to ash and rip off your mustache\n\n[Verse 10: Mario]\nWho are you insulting? Have you gone insane?\nI own this rap battle, this is my domain\nBy the way, who are you calling a sellout?\nSonic the Hedgehog is always trying to steal my clout\nI'll teach you a lesson so here is a taste\nYou're so ugly, your fans are to fix your face\nThis is true, so swallow the pill\nI'd run you over, but you're already roadkill\n\n[Verse 11: Sonic]\nOh well, I guess the ball is in my court\nYou're going downhill, someone call tech support\nWith any amount of skill, anyone can play you\nYour nose is so big, do you have the flu?\nSonic rules the world, everything is mine\nMario so greedy, you should pay a fine\nYou suck the fun out of games like a leech\nLater, I'm going to go dance with Princess Peach\n\n[Interlude: Announcer/Mario/Sonic]\nWow, that was a great round\nBefore we go on to round two\nType down below in the comments who won\nWhy did you say that about Princess Peach?\nYou don't even know who she is\nYou are very lucky, because we are in public\nOtherwise I teach a lesson about respect with my fists\nI've been cleaning out the trash for years now and I'll sweep the floor with you\nOnce we hit the second round, it's over for you\nWho are you kidding?\nYou're all washed up, Mario\nBoth you and Luigi couldn't beat me on your best days\nI've got a plan for round two so beware, you clown\nThe amount of tricks I've got up my sleeves will leave you shocked\nWhat sleeves? You're not even wearing a shirt\nListen, I've been brushing up on my rhymes, but I'm not a rapper though\nYou don't need to rhyme when you rap\nRapping comes from within\nIt's not about sounding fancy or using words you read out of a dictionary, Sonic\nOkay then, let's have a race right now\nWhoever wins the race can win the cartoon rap battle without going on to the second round\nDon't get all shy on me now, I know that if I asked you to do a jumping challenge, you would hop on it right away\nNo pun intended\nYou are working on my nerves\nDo you even know who you're talking to?\nI am Mario\nI am an icon living\nSo Sonic, are they ever going to fix your face for the movie?\nI heard about all the commotion that happened and I can't help but feel bad\nDon't feel bad, my fans only wanted me to get plastic surgery because they loved me\nI like to look at things in a positive light\nI'm just glad that people even care in the first place\nCould you imagine being a character who just gets ignored by the world\nBesides things could be much, much worse\nYeah, at least you're human like the rest of us\nOkay, boys, let's wrap things up\nNo pun intended\nThe second round is right around the corner\nPrepare yourselves\nToday, you've been given a chance to show your fanbase what you've got\nBy eliminating your opponent in a lyrical battle\nMany have tried to win the cartoon rap battles in the past\nBut have failed due to being either too confident or being too weak\nA balance is needed to win these things\nYour rapping skills must be perfectly balanced\nHey, you're starting to sound like Thanos\nCould you imagine if Thanos had a cartoon rap battle?\nThat would be hilarious\nYeah, what if Thanos went against the Avengers?\nThat would be wild\nToo bad that will never happen\n\n[Intro: Announcer]\nThanos\nVersus\nThe Avengers\nLet the cartoon rap battle begin\n\n[Verse 12: Black Thanos]\nYou all failed, so you came back to me\nI'm gonna snap the Avengers, like I did to the neck of Loki\nOnce I win this rap battle, I'll get the throne\nCaptain Marvel, you have as much personality as a stone\nThor, Iron Man, Rogers, all garbage on my list\nI'm glad I made half of humanity cease to exist\nSince I snapped, no more children need to be fed\nBy the way, Thor, you should've just gone for my head\n\n[Verse 13: Steve Rogers/Captain America]\nI'll make sure that you get a good butt kicking for that and pay\nYou could swing at the Avengers, but I can do this all day\nOnce I'm done with you, you're gonna need a bandage\nOkay team, let's go get this son of a-\n\n[Verse 14: Tony Stark/Iron Man]\nLanguage!\nWe won't lose again, this time we've got a plan\nHow low can you get, dude?\nYou took out Spider-Man\nYou love no one and no one loves you\nNow, here's a lesson in the art of kung-fu\nYour rap was as ugly as your chin\nLines so weak they belong in the trash bin\n\n[Verse 15: Thor]\nYou're evil, disgusting and filled with loads of strife\nThe only thing more pathetic would be your love life\nYou need a doctor? Go schedule an appointment\nThen ask \"what's the cure for ugly?\", the mortals call it ointment\nI am the son of Odin, powerful with prestige and glamour\nI think your face would look better once it's been crushed by my hammer\n\n[Interlude: Announcer]\nLadies and gentlemen\nMario vs. Sonic\n\n[Verse 16: Mario]\nRoses are red and violets are blue\nYou're a disgrace to the Sega crew\nYou are not part of the group\nSo watered down, I'll slurp you like soup\nIce on my shoes, wrist waters on my neck\nNice brother choose his daughter then I left\nRevelation has it you're as fast as a snail\nYour gimmick is running, way to be stale Mario vs. Sonic, you'll need some tonic\nI will just frolic, my rhymes are harmonic\nI won this battle, so please take note\nCan someone please pass the remote\n\n[Verse 17: Sonic]\nYour second round was worse than your first\nI'm already roasting you with the first verse\nOkay, I'll stop talking about running\nYou're still relevant, now that is stunning\nI wish Tails was here to help me win\nOh well, my power comes from within\nYour words mean nothing, I have thick skin\nJust like your video games, you belong in the bin\n\n[Verse 18: Mario]\nI am Mario\nI am the best at rapping\nI am sorry, bro\nYou're the next at lapping\nThree quarters of my skill can be lent to you\nUse it wisely, oh wait, you have no clue\nRoasting you is just a big hassle\nI'll lock you away in Bowser's Castle\nTry to jump and you will fall\nI got to go and take Princess Peach's call\n\n[Verse 19: Sonic]\nCome on, man, you're not even trying\nWhere's Tails? Cuz imma go flying\nI'm pretty sure I can do this all day\nWhen Mario shows up, no one wants to play\nYou still want to fight, then throw the first shove\nI see you copied my size, style and glove\nI'm like the sun, I shine in the summer\nI may be a hedgehog, but at least I'm not a plumber\n\n[Interlude: Mario/Sonic]\nYou know what?, You're not that bad, Sonic\nSame to you, Mario\nHey, sorry about the stuff I said earlier, I didn't really mean all that stuff\nOh no, no, don't apologize\nIt was funny, I was just acting tough\nI didn't want to let my fans down, they've supported me all these years\nI have a suggestion after the show, let's travel to each other's worlds\nI wouldn't mind joining you on an adventure\nFrom the sound of it, your world seems wild\nOf course, we can save the princess and go on a journey of a lifetime\nFriends?\nFriends!\n\n[Interlude: Black Sans/Isabella Dementia/Jeff the Killer/LoonaGooner/Banban]\nSo yeah, if you can come over here and get all these bastards out, that'd be amazing\nSure, we'll be there in, uh, 20 minutes roughly\nNo, Jeff the Killer, you cannot Jeff the Kill me in front of everyone at this party\nYes, I know I have girls coming around, but no, you cannot Jeff the Kill any of them either\nSo... is this what you asked for?\nAbsolutely not, I thought this label was just you and me, what's with all these other fuckas?\nI thought you'd appreciate the idea of getting way more people to diss Matti\nYeah, like the STV crew and all that, not fucking serial killers and jesters!\nLook, just be glad I was able to bring so many people together for this\nI'm not DJ Kay Slay, I'm Black Sans, do you think I can babysit all these guys?\nAyo bro, do you got some of that good kush here?\nNo, but we do have the mythical perc 60 in the Dr. Perky\nSeriously, like who are half of these guys?\nWell, we got Tyler, The Creator, Anuel AA, Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Ski Mask The Slump God, Eminem, Central Cee, Yuno Miles\nWait, huh, excuse me?\n\n[Verse 20: Eminem]\nI left my legacy hurt?

smoonker\nI'm the Linkara of hip-hop, the shit I say is all real\nSoon as KayBee loses their way then they'll feel the way I feel\nHit Tigggger with the trigger and leave Coin fuckin' spent\nAll while you become the bonemeal while I spend cash on fent\nI'm gon' slit your fuckin' throats, I will hang you like a coat\nIf you're dropping your next project, better get me in the booklet\nIf I'm not

scotch\nI will shoot you as you run, in your ass, I will cum\nThis was Black Sans and now his ass will be fully fuckin' jumped\n\n[Interlude: Black Sans/Lil Mabu]\nWait, what?-\nGet it, cuz blue and red equals purple, so I blew her back out and I left her on red, don't let that go over your head\n\n[Verse 31: Oreo]\n\nWay back when I was just a little bitty boy\nLiving in a box under the stairs\nIn the corner of the basement of the house\nHalf a block down the street from Jerry's Bait shop\nYou know the place\nWell anyway, back then life was going swell and everything was just peachy\nExcept, of course, for the undeniable fact that every single morning\nMy mother would make me a big ol' bowl of sauerkraut for breakfast\nDaww, big bowl of sauerkraut\nEvery single morning\nIt was driving me crazy\nI said to my mom\nI said \"Hey, mom, what's up with all the sauerkraut?\"\nAnd my dear, sweet mother\nShe just looked at me like a cow looks at an oncoming train\nAnd she leaned right down next to me\nAnd she said \"It's good for you\"\nAnd then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my mouth\nAnd force fed me nothing but sauerkraut\nUntil I was twenty six and a half years old\nThat's when I swore that someday\nSomeday I would get outta that basement and travel to a magical, far away place\nWhere the sun is always shining and the air smells like warm root beer\nAnd the towels are oh so fluffy\nWhere the Shriners and the lepers play their ukuleles all day long\nAnd anyone on the street will gladly shave your back for a nickel\nWacka wacka doo-doo yeah\nWell, let me tell you, people, it wasn't long at all before my dream came true\nBecause the very next day, a local radio station had this contest\nTo see who could correctly guess the number of molecules in Leonard Nimoy's butt\nI was off by three, but I still won the grand prize\nThat's right, a first class one-way ticket to\nAlbuquerque\nAlbuquerque\nOh yeah\nYou know, I'd never been on a real airplane before\nAnd I gotta tell ya, it was really great\nExcept that I had to sit between two large albino women\nWith excruciatingly severe body odor\nAnd the little kid in back of me kept throwin' up the whole time\nThe flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanuts\nAnd the in-flight movie was Bio-Dome with Pauly Shore\nAnd, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned out\nAnd we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside\nAnd the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died\nExcept for me\nYou know why?\n'Cause I had my tray table up\nAnd my seat back in the full upright position\nHad my tray table up\nAnd my seat back in the full upright position\nHad my tray table up\nAnd my seat back in the full upright position\nAh ha ha ha\nAh ha ha\nAh\nSo I crawled from the twisted, burnin' wreckage\nI crawled on my hands and knees for three full days\nDraggin' along my big leather suitcase and my garment bag\nAnd my tenor saxophone and my twelve-pound bowling ball\nAnd my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkel\nBut finally I arrived at the world famous Albuquerque Holiday Inn\nWhere the towels are oh so fluffy\nAnd you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna\nIt's OK, they're clean\nWell, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/C\nAnd I turned on the SpectraVision\nAnd I'm just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillow\nThat I love so very, very much when suddenly, there's a knock on the door\nWell now, who could that be?\nI say \"Who is it?\"\nNo answer\n\"Who is it?\"\nThere's no answer\n\"Who is it?\"\nThey're not sayin' anything\nSo, finally I go over and I open the door and just as I suspected\nIt's some big fat hermaphrodite with a Flock-Of-Seagulls haircut and only one nostril\nOh man, I hate it when I'm right\nSo anyway, he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkel\nAnd I'm like \"Hey, you can't have that\"\n\"That snorkel's been just like a snorkel to me\"\nAnd he's like \"Tough\"\nAnd I'm like \"Give it\"\nAnd he's like \"Make me\"\nAnd I'm like \"'Kay\"\nSo I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus\nAnd I bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows\nAnd I took out his appendix and he gave me a colonic irrigation\nYes indeed, you better believe it\nAnd somehow in the middle of it all, the phone got knocked off the hook\nAnd twenty seconds later, I heard a familiar voice\nAnd you know what it said?\nI'll tell you what it said\nIt said\n\"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again\"\n\"If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator\"\n\"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again\"\n\"If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator\"\nIn Albuquerque\nAlbuquerque\nWell, to cut a long story short, he got away with my snorkel\nBut I made a solemn vow right then and there that I would not rest\nI would not sleep for an instant until the one-nostrilled man was brought to justice\nBut first, I decided to buy some donuts\nSo I got in my car and I drove over to the donuts shop\nAnd I walked on up to the guy behind the counter\nAnd he says \"Yeah, what do ya want?\"\nI said \"You got any glazed donuts?\"\nHe said \"No, we're outta glazed donuts\"\nI said \"Well, you got any jelly donuts?\"\nHe said \"No, we're outta jelly donuts\"\nI said \"You got any Bavarian cream-filled donuts?\"\nHe said \"No, we're outta Bavarian cream-filled donuts\"\nI said \"You got any cinnamon rolls?\"\nHe said \"No, we're outta cinnamon rolls\"\nI said \"You got any apple fritters?\"\nHe said \"No, we're outta apple fritters\"\nI said \"You got any bear claws?\"\nHe said \"Wait a minute, I'll go check\"\n\"No, we're outta bear claws\"\nI said \"Well, in that case, in that case, what do you have?\"\nHe says \"All I got right now is this box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels\"\nI said \"OK, I'll take that\"\nSo he hands me the box and I open up the lid and the weasels jump out\nAnd they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin' me all over\nOh man, they were just going nuts\nThey were tearin' me apart\nYou know, I think it was just about that time\nThat a little ditty started goin' through my head\nI believe it went a little something like this\nDoh\nGet 'em off me\nGet 'em off me\nOh\nNo, get 'em off, get 'em off\nOh, oh God, oh God\nOh, get 'em off me\nOh, oh God\nAh, aah, aah\nI ran out into the street with these flesh-eating weasels all over my face\nWavin' my arms all around and just runnin', runnin', runnin'\nLike a constipated wiener dog\nAnd as luck would have it\nThat's exactly when I ran into the girl of my dreams\nHer name was Zelda\nShe was a calligraphy enthusiast\nWith a slight overbite and hair the color of strained peaches\nI'll never forget the very first thing she said to me\nShe said \"Hey, you've got weasels on your face\"\nThat's when I knew it was true love\nWe were inseparable after that\nAw, we ate together, we bathed together\nWe even shared the same piece of mint-flavored dental floss\nThe world was our burrito\nSo we got married and we bought us a house\nAnd had two beautiful children, Nathaniel and Superfly\nOh, we were so very very very happy, aw yeah\nBut then one fateful night, Zelda said to me\nShe said \"Sweetie pumpkin? Do you wanna join the Columbia Record Club?\"\nI said \"Whoa, hold on now, baby\"\n\"I'm just not ready for that kind of a commitment\"\nSo we broke up and I never saw her again\nBut that's just the way things go\nIn Albuquerque\nAlbuquerque\nAnyway, things really started lookin' up for me\nBecause about a week later, I finally achieved my lifelong dream\nThat's right, I got me a part-time job at The Sizzler\nI even made employee of the month after I put out that grease fire with my face\nAw yeah, everybody was pretty jealous of me after that\nI was gettin' a lot of attitude\nOk, like one time, I was out in the parking lot\nTryin' to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencil\nWhen I see this guy Marty\nTryin' to carry a big ol' sofa up the stairs all by himself\nSo I, I say to him, I say \"Hey, you want me to help you with that?\"\nAnd Marty, he just rolls his eyes and goes\n\"No, I want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw\"\nSo I did\nAnd then he gets all indignant on me\nHe's like \"Hey man, I was just being sarcastic\"\nWell, that's just great\nHow was I supposed to know that?\nI'm not a mind reader for cryin' out loud\nBesides, now he's got a really cute nickname, Torso-Boy\nSo what's he complaining about?\nSay, that reminds me of another amusing anecdote\nThis guy comes up to me on the street\nAnd he tells he hasn't had a bite in three days\nWell, I knew what he meant\nBut just to be funny, I took a big bite out of his jugular vein\nAnd he's yellin' and screamin' and bleeding all over\nAnd I'm like \"Hey, come on, don't you get it?\"\nBut he just keeps rolling around on the sidewalk, bleeding, and screaming\nYou know, completely missing the irony of the whole situation\nMan, some people just can't take a joke, you know?\nAnyway, um, um, where was I?\nKinda lost my train of thought\nUh, well, uh, OK\nAnyway I, I know it's kinda been a roundabout way of saying it\nBut I guess the whole point I'm tryin' to make here is\nI hate sauerkraut\nThat's all I'm really tryin' to say\nAnd, by the way, if one day you happen to wake up\nAnd find yourself in an existential quandary\nFull of loathing and self-doubt\nAnd wracked with the pain and isolation of your pitiful meaningless existence\nAt least you can take a small bit of comfort in knowing that\nSomewhere out there in this crazy ol' mixed-up universe of ours\nThere's still a little place called\nAlbuquerque\nAlbuquerque\nAlbuquerque, Albuquerque\nAlbuquerque, Albuquerque\nAlbuquerque, Albuquerque\nAlbuquerque, Albuquerque\nI said \"A\" (A)\n\"L\" (L)\n\"B\" (B)\n\"U\" (U)\n\"Querque\" (querque)\nAlbuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque\nAlbuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque\nAlbuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque\nAlbuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque\nAlbuquerque"
