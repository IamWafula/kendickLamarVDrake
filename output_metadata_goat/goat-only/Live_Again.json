    "When you look at my brothers, what's your first impression?",
    "Does the sight of us leave you guessin', or do you understand the stressin', the aggression?",
    "The look of no hope on my niggas' faces",
    "Like the Lord overlooked us when He handed down His graces?",
    "See, embraces fall short on the numb tips of street entrepeneur fingers",
    "Stuck in the walls of the project halls where the coke smell still lingers",

    "'Cause on the inside we been given nothin' to shine on",
    "And the gig is harder to get than coke, so niggas get their grind on",
    "'Cause the TV tells us \"Aim high, nigga, make all goals lateral\"",

    "Now, some niggas reclaim 'em, some blame 'em",
    "Makin' excuses to sell 'em",
