    "Whatever your mind is saying",
    "There's more to you than this physical part",
    "And there's more to all to you than the mental",
    "Here's another story on how we conceptualize human beings",
    "Champagne problems",
    "Where's the connection if leaving roses without him?",
    "I've been a splintered soul for so long",
    "I been double-dutching my thoughts",
    "Staring at these Venetian walls like asylums",
    "Saint Laurent carry-ons, it was handheld",
    "Turbulence didn't pan well",
    "My latest panic attack suffocated my damn sеlf",
    "Tryna count to ten backwards",
    "Fumblin' from them aspirins",
    "Sweating rеligiously, movin' all fidgety, my actions",
    "Got me feeling caged in, days out, days in",
    "Paved in, my shoulder's about to tip over",
    "How many worlds I'm holdin', wait a minute",
    "Mama callin' me, she want all of me",
    "Doctor say my Unc' got forty eight hours and his arteries turned it to twenty four",
    "How can you hide the fact that you had cancer and I ain't even know?",
    "Now you tell me I gotta answer, like, right before the show?",
    "I can't be incompetent, running from pressure",
    "How can I hesitate to respond to shit?",
    "I'm tryna console my mother, her younger brother was my twin",
    "On my first album cover, we made history",
    "I ascend generations of a newfound best",
    "Now I'm tryna fly his body back home before sound check",
    "I'm on the phone with funeral homes",
    "Private banks and strangers",
    "Hoping to transfer 50K to start the arrangements",
    "Mama sent me a text, him in his final moments",
    "Life smothers you, don't it? Pain is only a bonus",
    "Being in Europe that day seemed the most foreign to me..."
