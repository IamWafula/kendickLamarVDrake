    "Concepts of you and who I am",
    "There's a hold on me, ain't it strange",
    "There's a troubled spirit, hard to explain, yeah, yeah",
    "I feel somethin', I feel somethin'",
    "Sometimes reverence (Huh), sometimes pain (Huh)",
    "Sometimes both of them, it's hard to explain, yeah, yeah",
    "I feel somethin', I feel somethin'",
