    "Only thing matter right now is living right now when I can't spare no feelings",
    "Quiet on set, but my aura loud, I navigate through hood shit and wisdom",
    "The money all here, young man, fuck holding your hand, you'll die broke tryna play victim",
    "The little ideas I told made people go rogue until God did me a big one",
    "Reincarnated with love",
    "My Gemini twin back, powerin' up",
    "No more handshakes and hugs",
    "The energy only circulate through us",
    "Everybody must be judged",
    "But this time, God only favoring us",
    "20 years in, still got that pen dedicated to bare hard truth",
    "The еtiquette speak with a vigilant tonguе, the predicate this time is \"Fuck you\"",
    "I'm carrying heavier hearts right now, I can power lift with Olympians too",
    "I'm carrying various darts right now, I deserve this bitch like tiramisu",
    "See, we go body for body",
    "I hand you a body",
    "I'm prolly a better masseuse",
    "I really don't bother nobody, but they run it by me",
    "If I gotta clear out the— Christ!"
