Sound of the chrome plated woopa\nHouse flyin' straight to your medula, suit up\nWhen it's time for war, lace your boots up\nMy advice ; get your head bulletproofed up\nNo mercy, when the tool bust, smooch ya'\nLeave your ass asking for your future, who ya?\nI don't know ya', gotta show ya', folding dough like yoga\nDon't approach us, nurse bag get smoked fast like a penitentiary box\nOf cigarettes, (yeah) we still got that work posted on the ave\nNickle and dime bags of narcotics, I got it\nYou want it? No problem, still got the fiend shook like hydraulics"
