Much like Nas' classic One Love, this song speaks of prison life, how things change while the prisoner’s away and the ills of the… Read More \n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nI was sitting on the couch, reading yellow paper\nA letter in reply, 7 days later after I wrote 'em\n\"Stay strong, keep your faith in God,\" what I told him\nHoping that he's listening\nSaid that they tried to give him like a hundred years\nWhat a coincidence, I was bumping some Plies\n\nI can taste the salt from my tears\nAs the water had start to flood on my eyes\nI know it gotta be hard, being 21 doing time\nIn the pen and your Gram's old, your brother's getting older\n\nAnd the streets is getting colder\nAnd your hoping that he's focused to stay on the right road\nSleeping in a cell\nIt's been 30 weeks, ain't received any mail\nIt's cold and the hole stinks\n\nAnd you can't even blink without niggas testing your life\nAs I read every word that you write, I can only imagine\nJason Keaton, I can only imagine\n\n[Chorus: JaVonté]\nLife's about decisions, man\nIt's in your hand and you got it\nJust take control if you can\nIt's in your hand and you got it\n\n\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nSitting on the couch, that was my Uncle Bobby\nAfter he just got out, 15 years to count\nHaven't seen the world in so long\nHaven't seen a girl in so long\nAnd before the sun came up, he was gone\nLike a fiend off the best rock\nTrying to get his life together, or whatnot\nTyped his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity\nGot it straight, got a place, found some serenity\nFound a job, found his Mother's grave site, found a 40 ounce\nThen he found God, then he bounced\nThen he found a new chick\nTwo kids, wide hips\nFound something in her we didn't see\nFound this spot in Pasadena\nAnd shack with her, an investment\nThen found guilty, somebody had yelled Domestic\nViolence on my Uncle, was working with two strikes\nOnly out a year, now facing life\nI can only imagine\nThat's fucked up\nI can only imagine, Uncle Bob\n\n[Chorus: JaVonté]\nLife's about decisions, man\nIt's in your hand and you got it\nJust take control if you can\nIt's in your hand and you got it\n\n\n\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]\nSitting on the couch, thinking about the ratio of blacks in prison\nAs compact in prison, when blacks pack with minorities; system\nGrab more of these 18 year olds\n18 year sentence with no parole\nThe state won't oversee\nThey make the term severe, a conspiracy?\nThat's what I call it, it's full of shit\nA toilet can help quick, the government help?\nNo, just put us on death row\n\nJust give us some more guns, then give us some more coke\nThen give us another chair, then give us some more rope\nThen hang it like \"right there, yeah\"\nIt's justice for all, but 90 percent unfair\nCare? No\nAlcatraz was purchased by a white man\nFor 5 grand, with intentions to expand\nMore prisons\nSo these correctional ain't for rehabilitation, they for grossing a bigger business\n\nImagine\nWe're being used\nImagine\nThe truth shall be told\n\n[Chorus: JaVonté]\nLife's about decisions, man\nIt's in your hand and you got it\nJust take control if you can\nIt's in your hand and you got it"
