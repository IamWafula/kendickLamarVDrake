Coyotes in the room\nAnd I run it (Blow, blow, blow, blow!)\nAnd I run it (Blow, blow, blow, blow!)\nAnd I run it (Yeah, blow!)\nAnd I run it (Yeah, blow!)\nThat's ironic (Blow, blow, blow, blow!)\nI run it (Blow, blow, blow, blow!)\nThat's ironic (Yeah, blow!)\nI run it (Yeah, blow, yeah!)\nSalt all in my wounds\nHear my tears all in my tunes\nLet my life loose in this booth\nJust for you, mothafucka, hope y'all amused\nAnd I run it (Blow, blow, blow, blow!)\nAnd I run it (Blow, blow, blow, blow!)\nAnd I run it (Yeah, blow!)\nAnd I run it (Yeah, blow!)\nThat's ironic\nLiberation leader\nPopular pie plant pictured here\nWile E. Coyote, Wile E. Coyote\nThis shit make a nigga just wanna write\nReminisce when I had the morning appetite\nApple Jacks and after that, I hit the TV Guide\nAnimaniacs the only thing that gave me peace of mind\nI'm a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied\nTell a story that I'll never glory 25\nNot to worry, every warrior\nWill come and see you fully armed\nAnd that's a covenant I put on every tribe\nAin't nobody gon' tie your shoe\nNobody gon' abide by your rule\nNobody holding your gun\nHow come your tongue say killa then kill my mood?\nLightspeed living in the world you know\nLittle old me, feeling like a live wire\nBet I put some new tires on a lighting bolt\n'Til I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote\nI am from the bottom of the jungle\nLiving in the bottom of the food chain\nWhen you get a new chain, nigga take it from you\nA new name, want stripes\nAnd you and zebra look alike\nHope another homicide don't numb you and none do\nThings we will never learn soon\nIn the era where we wanna earn soon\nThat's a error, you can smell it in the air\nAnd everybody really doomed\nThat's why I'm backdooring you motherfuckas\nAll y'all can suck my dick\nAll them days at the county building\nNow I'm 'bout to make my mama rich\nCartoons and (Cereal!)\nI ain't felt this good since Scrooge McDuck\n(Here we go!) Elementary hood shit\nNow, I was raised in a sandbox\nNext to you and her\nYou was holding the handgun\nShe was giving birth\nTo a baby boy to be just like you\nI wonder what's that worth\nI wonder if you ever knew\nThat you was a role model to me first\nThe next day I woke up in the morning\nSeen you on the news\nLooked in the mirror, then realized\nI had something to prove\nYou told me \"Don't be like me\"\n\"Just finish watching cartoons\"\nWhich is funny now\n'Cause all I see is Wile E.

Coyotes in the room\nSalt all in my wounds\nHear my tears all in my tunes\nLet my life loose in this booth just for you\nMuhfucka, hope y'all amused\nI did wrong, karma came\nCrackers gave me ball and chain\nFriends, enemies all the same\nState, fed, both can hang\nNobody can mute me\nBut I never said nobody can't shoot me\nJust another stat to the white folks\nStill whip work to the white yolk, absolutely\nEveryday feel like the one before\nHunt the money, don't hunt the ho\nIf you do what you always done\nThen you get what you always got\nYou dumb buffoons\nI ain't seen the back of my eyelids\nFor about the past 72 hours\nHand on my heart, face to the hood\nI pledge every word you ever heard was honest\nYeah this me, no mic\nNo cameras, no lights, just pain\nMama how much trauma can I sustain?\nDirty money come with lots of stains\nRoad to riches come with lots of lanes\nJust another player with lots of game\nNever had shit, got lots to gain\nJust another player with lots of game\nNever had shit, got lots to gain\nSource: Musixmatch\nSongwriters: Kendrick Lamar / Don Logan\nCartoon & Cereal lyrics © Wb Music Corp., Hard Working Black Folks Inc., Top Dawg Music"
